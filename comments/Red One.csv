Cheese here and there, and Rock going to Rock, but I think it had some good heart for Christmas, was entertaining, and that&#39;s all that really matters. Outside of this, who decided to make the reindeer &quot;female&quot;? And please don&#39;t go quoting some science guide stating that male reindeer lose their antlers in the winter when Santa&#39;s reindeer are magical and can fly... I didn&#39;t find the movie to be woke, and had no problem with the diversity presented. Only thing that brought me out of it was having all the reindeers be female. :/"

@Gruffydom,2024-12-28T05:54:47Z,2024-12-28T05:54:47Z,0,It was a failure because they made the Santa character the minor character in his own movie. It became another generic movie with the Rock in it. <br>A Xmas movie that wasn’t really about Santa but another vehicle for the Rock to “earn” another few tens of millions of dollars. That’ll be why it failed.

The movie brought out the 8-year-old boy in me, while also providing a plausible explanation for how Santa can visit every house on earth in one night.  My only regret is with Dwayne Johnson&#39;s acting -- I don&#39;t know why he played his part so stiffly.  I want to give him the benefit of the doubt and say that he was told to act that way, but then again, I haven&#39;t seen him in other movies.  He seemed to be rushing through some of his lines.  Anyway, I&#39;m already on my second run-through of this movie and look forward to revisiting it again next year.  Kavalame!"

@iJohn24,2024-12-20T15:48:24Z,2024-12-20T15:48:24Z,0,Meh. Where is Christ in CHRISTmas? One more anti Christ film by Hollywood. Even by itself the film is at max just okay if not lesser. Also why didn&#39;t you all show India at the end? There are many Christians in India. There are more than 27 Million Indian Christians. This film is all about merry and nonsense and no Jesus Christ. What a shame. Even St. Nicholas will be unhappy.

@Gkm-,2024-12-20T03:03:08Z,2024-12-20T03:03:08Z,1,"Huge disappointment. Childish dailogues, bad graphics, illogical scenes, poor screenplay, and ordinary story makes Red one a painful watch if you pay attention. The movie looses you interest in the first 20 minutes. You expect way more than this when you got Dwayne and Chris in 1 movie. Kids might enjoy the movie though."

Thanks God it’s released earlier, but this movie is not suitable for young children, they got scared and cried over seeing Snowmen and Krampus, I can’t believe why the parents would have brought them to watch this Movie which they supposed to be enjoying Moana 2. Anyway, this is a must watch Christmas movie mainly for 10 years old and above (っ◔◡◔)っ ♥."

Okay all.tge other parts of the trailer also tell me what kind of movie it is. They had a few good ideas, but they look poorly executed for cheap laughs for an audience that gets bored after one minute without action and cheap VFX (I have nothing against good VFX).<br>Since I&#39;m German I also got the trailer in German, which gives the movie even more C to Z movie quality.
