I appreciate to see that it’s portrayed in a horror film because true horror films makes you feel uncomfortable as a true horror movie fan and I never usually see trichotillomania portrayed in anything.

Lol, seems a little far-fetched to me. But I&#39;m guessing they chose a pop star for the ending, so the entity could infect the audience, but instead of a pop star I think a social media influencer would have been more realistic, and could also have a larger audience, millions of people instead of the thousands that I&#39;m guessing was in attendance at the concert."

If you&#39;re going to tell the same story again with smile devil winning over, what&#39;s the point of making the part 2 at all???

In my opinion, it’s probably one of the best and scariest horror movies I’ve seen in years. Everything—from the production to the acting—is truly impressive. Well done Parker Finn!"

The beginning is not great but it grabs your attention and then ... 90 min nothing before a weak end. The story has an extremely slow reveal. What you see in the 2 minutes trailer is the only interesting moments in the whole 2 hours movie. That&#39;s it, nothing more."

If you like atmospheric set pieces, a sense of slow, creeping dread, sheer hallucinogenic disorientation, superb performances by the lead &amp; supports, well-timed jump scares &amp; brutal, but justified climaxes, look no further. All in all, a massive step up from its excellent predecessor."

There are jump scares, but they are not cheap ones that feel corny or are predictable. Sound design is annoying at times IMO but a lot of the time the score really builds tension. Best horror movie I have seen in a while. Loved the ending. Some will find the ending to be a bit contrived though."

This one was basically the stupid ending to the last smile the entire movie. It made 0 sense. It wasn&#39;t scary. It was goody if anything. And this &quot;actress&quot; was the worst..... absolutely no acting ability at all. I&#39;m so sad cause I really liked the first one even with the ending. This movie used gore to compensate for the terrible acting and lack of substance.

Never in a million years I thought Naomi Scott is able to portray sadness, fear, vulnerability and all the package to this level. She gives her everything here. Personally, I don’t think she’ll top herself pretty soon. She’s phenomenal here."

@acetreyner2906,2024-09-12T14:32:25Z,2024-09-12T14:32:25Z,0,"I feel like this movie is going to end similar to the truth or dare movie. Like how the girl asked everyone on Youtube truth or dare so it wouldn&#39;t get back to her. She is going to off herself on stage for thousands of people to see effectively ended the curse. Idk the lore behind this movie maybe it doesn&#39;t work that way. But how could a demon, entity, whatever over take that many people."

She gets a happy ending return to touring and then her buddy shows up and she dies. Hard pass. First one was fun but this seem pointless and horribly executed. Probably would have made more sense to follow the cop character from how the first movie ended...

(I’m still going with my theory that the Smile Demon’s name is Agares because if you look at the Goetia sigil of Agares the bottom part of the sigil looks like a smile, this I believe that this demon’s name is Agares.
