Cynthia&#39;s vocals at the end blew me away and I fell in love with her character. If you are like me and always felt like you were missing that manual on &quot;how to be&quot; like everyone else seemingly has, then you will relate to her so much.

I love her inpersonations of different celebrities.  She&#39;s really talented and her voice is amazing.  Thing is she&#39;s really funny. 😂
@fiddleandfart,2025-02-03T00:53:39Z,2025-02-03T00:53:39Z,1,Overlong trailer for a leadenly stodgy film!  And no decent memorable songs apart from &quot;Defying Gravity!&quot;  How could a 2&#39;45 (with interval) stage musical become a 2&#39;40 film that&#39;s only half the story?  Answer: by being made by an indulgent director with no sense of pace!  Really disappointing!  And not recommended!  Not sure if I can bear to suffer Part Two!!

@aryanshukla7305,2025-01-19T17:09:24Z,2025-01-19T17:09:24Z,2,I like this interpretation more the traditional story does not really tell much after the fall of the royal dynasty and the witches ascension to power in the four lands so it makes it easier to explore and I like that they show the wizard holding power over all of oz before the witches restrict his authority to the imperial city
@windmill99,2025-01-19T06:12:47Z,2025-01-19T06:12:47Z,2,Was not for me despite feeling excited to see. I feel this movie was disjointed and tacky…. Anyone else feel Legally Blonde directors might sue of the Glinda thing?

I felt so many different feelings I haven&#39;t gotten from film in ages. Musicals aren&#39;t my cup of tea but man, I feel like I&#39;m missing out on what theatre kids love and I want a piece of it too now that I&#39;ve seen this.

I didn’t want any spoilers. I did see the musical live 5 times so I knew how it would go but I didn’t want any movie spoilers. Every time the trailer came on tv I muted it and closed my eyes. I’m glad  went into the movie like this. Trailers today just give way too much away.

Turns out the whole thing is musical I had to fast forward through half of it at least. This would have been a lot better if it didn&#39;t have as much musical in it and more of the story. Not something I would watch again. I&#39;m going to give it a thumbs down and a 4/10

@Raphael-2,2024-12-28T18:17:52Z,2024-12-28T18:17:52Z,1,"I was quite excited about this movie, last movie I saw in the cinemas was years ago. I saw it yesterday and I have to say it I&#39;m sorry, the plot was so poorly written and I didn&#39;t even know it was possible for a fantasy movie to have this few action until the ending scene. I mean the whole movie we&#39;re like &quot;what&#39;s happening to the animals&quot;, &quot;we got to save the animals&quot; etc but literally nothing is done or explained further about that the entire movie so.. my point is if you&#39;re looking for a really good story because you like fantasy movies like Narnia, Harry Potter, The Golden Compass, Percy Jackson etc.. you will not like this movie. But if you&#39;re just there for the music and the decors and outfits then yes this movie is awesome and fabulous. The songs were fantastic, great singing, great acting. I&#39;m just sad the plot was so poor it was like a group project of 10 years old with so many absurdities and unexplained stuff.<br>Anyways... plot = 2/10, cinematography and music = 10/10."

Given the film&#39;s roots as a Broadway musical, I felt the musical numbers slowed any momentum it had from becoming a truly great film. Despite its only flaw, Wicked fittingly sets the tone for its sequel set to release next year as it continues to explore what makes a villain &quot;Wicked.&quot;"

If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. 16 For all that is in the world—the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life—is not of the Father but is of the world. 17 And the world is passing away, and the lust of it; but he who does the will of God abides forever."

Yes, they are great singers but they are singing music which is absolute trite and forgettable. Now that I recall the original Oz I realize she did what she intended with the animals, Dorothy&#39;s friends. And it&#39;s an interesting twist with Glinda which I never noticed in the original, she actually didn&#39;t assist Dorothy at all but was just a cheerleader. Very interesting."

I&#39;m hesitant about seeing this because I&#39;m such a fan and I think I&#39;ll be disappointed with any type of screen adaptation of it. Is my concern well-founded and should I stay home... or should I go and see it on screen anyway? I&#39;d appreciate input from anyone kind enough to make it objective as possible. Thanks.

@wagnerwantuy3021,2024-12-04T23:30:32Z,2024-12-04T23:30:32Z,1,"I would love for Broadway plays to be produced on two platforms: the stage, which is already established and continues to thrive, maintaining this classic and incredible tradition, and streaming platforms, which would help promote this amazing art form to tourists and loyal audiences, offering the chance to experience something different. I&#39;m sure one experience wouldn&#39;t diminish the desire to see the other, and both tourists and locals would be even more curious to check them out. Additionally, people living in other countries or those without access could continue to enjoy the magic and brilliance of this incredible culture, which sparked a desire in people like me to one day experience it up close, without letting this dream fade away. Sadly, today the genre isn&#39;t as prevalent among new generations, where it’s not seen as much on screen. But when I was a child, I would watch it on TV, and I still find it all enchanting."

@joeybaseball7352,2024-12-02T12:14:29Z,2024-12-02T12:14:29Z,1,"In 100 years, people will view Wicked the same way we view The Wizard of Oz. Wicked will even end up surpassing the legacy of The Wizard of Oz. I think people living in the year 2124 will hold Wicked with more reverence than they will The Wizard of Oz. I think for all future public domain properties (when Wicked becomes public domain), all the Oz stories will be following the Wicked plot, rather than The Wizard of Oz plot. I think that the Wizard will simply become an event that happened at Oz. To the point where people will think the Dorothy event will just be a sub-plot, and not realize that it was creation of the Oz franchise. This is why the public domain is so important people. Things should go into the public domain 50 years after it&#39;s first commercial publication. Things from 1975 should be public domain now."

Actual wickedness is &quot;chosen&quot; by a person, not something that happens &quot;to&quot; them. But, environmental or societal factors may make the choice more likely (peer pressure, competition for survival, and other powerful factors). You have to ask why, in a children&#39;s movie, this question is deliberately posed in such a confusing and illogical way, as if to disguise the real moral/spiritual issues."

The movie was acceptable if that. It’s not epic. The best time in history to produce a film with absolutely no limitations whatsoever, and we’ve somehow managed to make movies that are so bad that anything from the 90’s is more intricate and realistic even with the incredible technology that we currently have. I haven’t seen an actual epic movie since 2015."

Letting the minds of young people be injured by scripts like this is how a society is taken over.  <br><br>A talented animator left one of the big studios once they admitted to him they put the mannerisms, sayings, and likeness into the villains in modern movies.<br><br>They do this to destroy their real world enemies (one of them was openly admitted to be religion).  <br><br>Kids under a certain age do not critically think well.  If sayings like, &quot;The family is the backbone of a society&quot; are uttered by the villain after an act of depravity, the child&#39;s brain grows to think whatever was said is bad, in this case, family.  <br><br>This animator just happened to be religious and demanded they remove his name from the credits and he quit.  <br><br>As adults, feel free to watch inversions such as this without worry, but taking your children to see something like this risks losing what has taken generations to build."

I can see the WHOLE UNITED STATES BECOMING LIKE NEW ORLEANS. Cheers🫡

Now she&#39;s Universals new princess. Not sure she&#39;s the best choice! Do a search. It was all over the news a few years back."

And it didn&#39;t translate to film. At all.

But the one thing I would like to point out is the entire cast and crew who made this movie, you can tell they really care about the source material. With a run time of almost 3 hrs you barely notice the musical numbers. Most of the time I was more focused on the story rather than a song itself. Tbh I saw it for Arianna and she did not disappoint, surprisingly good comedic timing. I really liked the introduction scene, how it was setup, burning the “witch” and left it with a cliffhanger question “You guys were friends”. IMO it really looked like Glinda was/is the villain, which would be cool! 😂 10/10"

It&#39;s like some people are so miserable they dont wanna give the roses or sun it&#39;s credit or stars how beautiful they are. Where grateful for the dirt and the rocks highly but guge beauty its credit because you can see on every person with light skin and colored eyes social media they have tons of followers so Jist put them in the movies at least give those you cast enhanced features its a movie.

@MunchVIP,2024-11-20T15:35:54Z,2024-11-20T15:35:54Z,0,This is actually a marvel multiverse movie. Deadpool sends Ariana Grande into the Wizard of Oz multiverse to save the Hulks sister. With the power of friendship and singing Ariana Grande try’s to bring the Hulks sister back to marvel.

@angelakrotov247,2024-11-20T13:30:01Z,2024-11-20T13:30:01Z,0,No doubt Ariana can act. I watched her on Broadway when I was in high school. When I saw her acting and singing I had a feeling she was gonna be a big star. She was on the musical called “thirteen”

@AzguardMike,2024-11-20T10:19:01Z,2024-11-20T10:19:01Z,0,"gonna make a guess. Witch starts off all pure and good and full of agency, but then the evil white wizard of oz MAN puts her down, being all &quot;no you&#39;re this ad your place in Oz is ...&quot; which leads her to turn evil. Prior to that, all the other women will be supportive, smashing the patriarch and standing up against that evil white man. <br><br>its basically any Disney show, film and most adverts since 2012"

I also just realized that this movie is just Wicked part one and that part two will be out next November. My excitement for this movie is much lesser now.

It was a fully booked theater, the gasps, claps, screams of so many people at the same time. This is truly a cinematic masterpiece. I thought I wasn&#39;t going to like it but both actresses went above and beyond to deliver. My husband who hates musicals, loved it and gave it a 9/10 (he didn&#39;t give it a 10 because like I said, he hates musicals) this was a beautiful family experience where people of all ages got together and I can truly say it felt like being a little kid again. This was beautiful"

@TWO-ICE-SU,2024-11-16T09:50:57Z,2024-11-16T09:54:15Z,0,Why do I feel like Practical stage in the original &quot;Wizard of OZ&quot; is more real than this multi million green screen CG movie. I admit Some of them are practically shot in a set but the effort to put in these huge set is devalued by the filter of CG. It still feel like CG even if it is real.

Teasers are enough before the movie release. Besides this sympathy for evil itself is idiocy and pointless if your actions are evil in the end. Like it says in batman begins &#39;&#39; its not who you are underneath (who u are or where you come from)  but what you do that defines you&#39;&#39;.   Actions matter. Being evil is a choice. Over woke will go broke surely unless they are good movies with good screenplay like  Black panther 1 where you actually feel for killmonger the villian."

With so much entertainment as the modern day opiate to the masses to divert people’s attention, these weapons of mass distraction easily render people oblivious to see what is really happening in the world.  Compound that with the lowest common denominator appealing to the most prurient interests such as pornography, crass materialism (using mind control techniques to manipulate consumers into spending money on false promises of sex, status and happiness), entertainment that dually serves as propaganda along with the mesmerizing effects captivated by sports that also draw enormous amounts of money, and the oligarchs have us right where they want us – numbed and dumbed.<br><br>Even the flicker rates of televisions, videos, computers and cinema by design are all programmed to contain hidden properties that physically resonate and alter the human brain’s alpha wave state to induce a hypnotic, mesmerizing, trancelike state of mind.  This literally drugs and distorts the cognitive processes of the mass audience being subliminally fed input that modify and shape values, moral and ethical messages and multiple autosuggestions that carry powerful binding effects on people’s unconscious minds and future behavior.  This too is another form of calculated brainwashing, mind control as well as behavior control that the media as vehicles of propaganda and disinformation constantly utilize.  The constant 24/7 sensory bombardment that media puts on humans is one highly effective means of control over both culture and population.&quot; - <b>Article</b> - <b>&quot;The Dumbing Down of America - By Design&quot;.</b>"

But When Did the Wicked Witch ever ever ever grow up to be From a Green colored Singing Black woman then get turned into an old White Green Woman That Never Sings ? Can one person in this world point out any Black green people in the Wizard of Oz Franchise ? Will Tom Hanks Ever Play A Black Slave With No Black Makeup On in say 12 Years a Slave Part 2 ? It makes No sense. Let Alone This movie looks wall to wall CGI crap too , nothing looks real in it at all. Itis Baffling. Did the Filmmmakers ever See the Wizard Of Oz movies ?

I always worry whenever they bring a musical to the silver screen because all too often they miss the mark, but the trailers have definitely given me hope for this one.  The only thing I worry about is the idea of splitting this into two films (especially since the majority of the most memorable songs are sung in the first Act/Part).

There will be backlash so the movie needs to be outstanding in the eyes of the general public or else it will get “rinsed”. Film produces really need to control their left-wing actors, as lately they have greater potentially to lose them money.....e.g. Disney? So far, 74k &quot;dislikes&quot;👎, 231k &quot;likes&quot;👍but most done before the controversy. She needs to put it to bed now for the sake of the movie’s long-term reputation but I don’t think she will? Typical far left WOKE activists are proven a liability to the industry. Cynthia has just invited even more people to make fan/mock art and un-complimentary comments. 👏👏👏Well done, next looney please!🤡"

It&#39;s happening over and over and over again. They take these amazing and timeless IPs and destroy them with their own personal crap or society&#39;s crap. Either way the IP being changed gets crapped on and perverted into something it should&#39;ve never been. A complete hypocrisy of the Baum&#39;s works and his views he wrote into them! Shameful and disgraceful! I hope and pray this movie bombs. Also the Erivo actress is a wackjob attacking her own fans because of Woke, DEI, Leftist indoctrination has taught her she&#39;s a victim, a &quot;movie star&quot; victim just because she&#39;s black. That&#39;s racism at its core. Because True racists make everything about Race!"

As someone who loves the musical, i was excited there was a movie coming out for this. And then I&#39;ve been served with this. First of all. They butchered all the songs. Ariana grande needs to be stopped. Second, the cgi is garbage. Third, why the heck is there a fighting montage? For some reason Hollywood makes it so that in every movie with a school has to have some sort of fighting class. Finally, this just looks like a cash grab. The only good part is when Galenda says she doesn&#39;t want to give away the hat because she doesn&#39;t hate anyone that much, and then gives Elphaba the hat. Overall, i don&#39;t think to much heart was put into it , and it needs a new soundtrack. Also why haven&#39;t they mentioned that there&#39;s going to be 2 parts? Super dumb. I liked the set though."

This should be able to bring this great novel to many more people. The book had a little bit of everything in this prequel story that led up to the Wizard of Oz! Love, sex, betrayal, politics, friendship, advocacy, power, government and control. I always enjoyed the musical but was bummed it only scratched the surface of the story that unfolded in the novel.

@darkalo1984,2024-09-15T09:13:11Z,2024-09-15T09:13:11Z,1,Nothing better than making OZ the evil white man character and the evil green (black)  the best person among them all.<br><br>The same with John Hammond in Jurassic World Dominion for example. But evil women&#39;s characters are all being turned good just because so. Maleficent being the prime example.

I look forward to movies not being afraid to just make their antagonists into bad / evil characters. This doesn&#39;t necessarily mean I want them to be shallow or simple -- it is possible to have complex, evil villains that we are not told (told being the key phrase here, it&#39;s tiresome when films shove that concept down our throat) to have sympathy for."

@robertschlemmer6032,2024-08-15T05:08:25Z,2024-08-15T05:08:25Z,2,"So another movie about  the evil, racist,  white patriarchy discriminating against a &quot;person of color/strong female protagonist&quot;, and due to &quot;inequity&quot; was forced to be the villian of the story when the whole she (assuming that&#39;s the right pronoun) was actually the hero the entire time.<br>Sorry, but I think I&#39;ll spend Thanksgiving eating turkey while commemorating the colonization and subjugation of the Indigenous people."

@Brandonm096,2024-08-08T03:06:34Z,2024-08-08T03:06:34Z,1,It looks like an off and odd movie to me. Ariana doesn’t look authentic but the green witch looks like a new star on the rise🎉❤
@weaveroznerol1553,2024-08-08T02:01:36Z,2024-08-08T02:01:36Z,1,The way she flips the cape towards the end... I&#39;m MELTING!!!
@BillofRights1951,2024-08-07T23:21:18Z,2024-08-07T23:21:18Z,0,"The film will do well with women, and Grande&#39;s loyal fan base....but the trailer plays like an extended music video.  Way too many special effects and production overdesign, which truly makes everything look fake, as opposed to magical.  Also it&#39;s clear there&#39;s a big woke quotient to this vehicle.  Looks like yet another tired &#39;girl power&#39; assault.  No thanks.  The music sounds so canned and digitally compressed.  The whole enterprise is like prepackaged produce."
@michaelfrost3596,2024-08-07T21:15:48Z,2024-08-07T21:15:48Z,1,Am I the only one that is not a fan of Cynthia Erivo in this role. Amazing voice and but she doesn&#39;t seem awkward enough.  It is like when when would put a pair of glasses and out of style clothing on an atractive actress and make her play a nerd.
