I think my only criticism is that the characters lean a little too hard into ‘unlikeable enough to get audiences to agree to their deaths/pray for their downfall’ ish. The ending was really fun tho I liked it"

@misschalupabish2212,2024-02-10T19:01:09Z,2024-02-10T19:34:50Z,12,"I just watched this movie yesterday and I was SUPER pumped to see it but then I left the movie theater feeling quite disappointed. I feel the idea for this movie was there but the execution was definitely not… it had its few quirky moments but that was it. I feel there was a lot of waisted potential to expand on a lot of the ideas they had and to also add backstories scenes to many of the characters. I think this movie would’ve been great if there was more commotion /problem added to the conflict making the resolution just even more dramatic and heartfelt for the two main characters . In the movie one of the guys that Lisa helped kill (Doug) whom they later found out his dad I believe was a detective , and would later get involved in the case of his sons’s sudden disappearance. I feel the movie could’ve been better if they went more in depth with that and with the drama and commotion of the police looking for her because she was wanted as a notorious murderer. This movie could’ve included some more flashbacks of her mom. Just overall this movie needed more in depth details. It was kinda dry to watch and not a lot of juicy events occurred,that viewers usually crave for. I also wished there was more romance scenes between the two main characters but oh well. Despite all this, the movie had some funny moments and cute scenes. I would not watch again or recommend but still cute."

Let me start off by saying I just got home from watching this movie, I actually got to see a sneak preview of it. I see it&#39;s not out until but Wednesday, I got to see it before anybody my review of it is even though it was some crotchy old MF. They were trying to ruin the movie for a minute. Because it didn&#39;t like what I said.  And he bought a ticket for it and accused me of not being handicapped. Who cares set wherever and then argued with me that he&#39;s been there for 20 years, which I&#39;ve never seen him anyways. The review of the movie is it worth seeing. Yes, yes, it is maybe a blow down of it, the father. The father&#39;s a joke. Okay, he&#39;s a is a moron that&#39;s supposed to be like 1989.  She said I think it was the end of 1989 so it would be about. 1989 1990 air. It&#39;s fun to relive the 80s all over again. That&#39;s where I come from. I&#39;m actually a 70s child. So I was wondering joy that all over again. That was funny. I enjoyed it if you&#39;re going in there looking for a horror movie. I&#39;m sorry to say this is not a horror movie. It&#39;s more of a horror comedy type thing. Like I said, the father he&#39;s a joke.  He&#39;s clueless, so what&#39;s going on? He reminded me of Brad Mage. Brad major Majors from the Rocky horror picture show the total dweeb. The stubborn was a total b****The stop sister, she was an airhead cheerleader and then Lisa we saw a transformed like a flower. She was a timid little thing , and then by the end of the movie she&#39;s GOTH. One spoiler, I&#39;ll give you A. What One spoiler I&#39;ll give you is there is going to be a Just by the way, it was. Just by the way, it left off. I get but a 13 out of 13 skulls for nostalgia for the humor everything I. I heard a lot of people came out complaining about it. I don&#39;t like care. You know, they went in. Probably thinking it was a horror movie I saw the trailer for Then a horror movie. So I give it a 13 out of 13 skulls I. I highly recommend that if you said. Get a chance to see it. I think it comes out Wednesday or Friday. I think you should take advantage of it. So that&#39;s my recommendation. I think you should go check. It out"

Honestly Kathryn Newton looks so much like a young Heard. The guy playing the monster here, Cole Sprouse, with the makeup reminds so much of Edward Scissorhands."
