@marcella8496,2024-08-23T06:16:19Z,2024-08-23T06:16:19Z,2,"Great movie, I love it! There&#39;s everything: love, action (great action indeed!), fun, moral teaching, and I just adore the soundtrack, my songs from the 80s revisited. I sang along all the time! Blunt and Gosling are supercool and the chemistry between them is strong, the director Leitch is simply a genius in the way he orchestrated all the scenes, which are supported by novel ideas in both the sequence and the effects and insight into the characters&#39; personality. This movie is going to be my movie🧡"

It&#39;s the kind of film that makes you want to quit watching movies for a bit. Two hours and seven minutes of cringefest. Do yourself a favor and skip it. The only somewhat decent part is the fight with the leopard-head drug dealer. Other than that, I was bored out of my mind, just waiting for it to end. A 7.1 on IMDb? They must be tweaking.

@EveryBeardHasAStory,2024-05-29T18:54:40Z,2024-05-29T18:54:40Z,0,"This genuinely hurts. Seeing Ryan be cast in these senseless it movies is completely the opposite of all the things that make his acting great. When I heard he was in Barbie my stomach legitimately turned, and now seeing this... It&#39;s like watching the death of his career. Not financially, no, but the soul of his acting is fading away. All good things come to an end sooner than they should in flames."

So funny all the way through<br><br>Also not normally a massive fan of Ryan Gosling. The Mrs loves him I like to torment her and say he&#39;s rubbish. Can&#39;t deny the guy nailed this part. After watching the film I couldn&#39;t see anybody else doing it now. Loved the original show too

Blunt is great but plays a character which is the complete OPPOSITE of Jody. So why steal the classic show&#39;s name &amp; premise? Well, a combination or greed, laziness, lack of talent and cultural appreciation. They might as well called it &quot;The A Team&quot;, &quot;Mission Impossible&quot; or &quot;Star Trek&quot;. At any case you get two 40 year old actors behaving like two 14 year old kids using names of grown ups from a classic TV show about something else. They even changed the lyrics of original song in the name of political correctness. Shameful and completely unnecessary.

There&#39;s lots of action, of course, but it&#39;s extremely hard to figure out what&#39;s going on in the movie, and the dialogue between actors makes absolutely no sense much of the time. Even with all the action, the audience was very quiet throughout the movie, and that&#39;s usually the best indicator that you&#39;ve got a bomb of a movie. A total waste of money and a Friday night. 😐"

@gzuzpizana6586,2024-05-04T02:42:37Z,2024-05-04T02:42:37Z,0,Okay I get what they&#39;re doing it&#39;s pretty cool that they&#39;re doing a movie of The Fall Guy which is a TV show one of the best TV shows ever but after looking at the trailer I can tell it&#39;s going to be a flip-flop messed up movie it&#39;s not going to have all the right characters which they already got the wrong characters for the film that don&#39;t even fit the script of the Fall Guy I figured that it would be just the way it was as the TV show no matter how much they try to do remix of old TV shows for a movie they always end up missing it up destroying the image of the TV show in the TV show was much better than this movie here but I think I&#39;m going to have to give it probably won&#39;t start one thumb up I can already tell it&#39;s going to be a sloppy movie with sloppy characters they don&#39;t even fit the same characters as the TV show the storyline is all messed up completely but I&#39;ll give it a chance check it out and see if it&#39;s any good but I think that they need to leave the old TV shows alarm I mean they messed up this one dukes of hazzard&#39;s chips now they want to do a remake of Smokey and the bandit which they did and they destroyed the image of Smokey and the bandit every single TV show did they put on scream they destroyed the image of the TV show so now we got another flip-flop movie that&#39;s probably looks pretty interesting I wouldn&#39;t mind watching it but you cannot steal the power of the Fall Guy of the TV show the TV show is still number one is still the best and it&#39;s better than this lot that they&#39;re fixing to do right now I can&#39;t wait to see it we&#39;ll give it a chance

They use that chorus to build tension so many times, by the last time i&#39;ve heard it the guitar riff feels deflating. They also heavily edited it to correspond to motions in the trailer, so attention was put into the use of the song, and its a good trailer visually, but by the end my mind is primed for an underwhelming cookie cutter experience with no heart."

@CamoShirt,2024-04-23T10:52:18Z,2024-04-23T10:52:18Z,0,everyone seems satisfied but im not feeling it. in the tv show the stuntman was a bit long in the tooth and was a bounty hunter. much more to work with if they stuck with that premise and used brad pitt or matthew mcconaughey. guess im just getting old but everything seems like a watered down teeny bopper version of what it used to be. whether the old action stars were actually any tougher than the up and comers they just seemed tougher.

@brajeshsingh2391,2024-02-21T13:19:34Z,2024-02-21T13:19:34Z,0,this is good. A stunt man goes to find a leading man to save his ex&#39;s movie and career. This is an original script. And this proves that good ideas are always in plain sight than in complicated areas. Plus chemistry between Blunt and Gosling looks good.<br>This might do very well. Only thing this looks very processed rather than natural. We know everything is shot behind green screen but some more effort should have been placed to make it gritty.

@mugrad1988,2024-01-05T14:33:52Z,2024-01-05T14:33:52Z,6,"This is why most Americans love movies.  Fun, escapist, non-political, quick one-liners, and action.  Not every movie has to be a &quot;statement.&quot;  Those don&#39;t make money.  If Hollywood wants people to go to the theaters again, make some movies like this."
