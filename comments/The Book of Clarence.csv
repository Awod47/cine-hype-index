Where is the blasphemy in that 🧐 did I watch a different movie from the majority of people in the comments 🤷🏽‍♀️ maybe I did 🚶🏾‍♂️"

@demetriusgarrett5822,2024-03-26T10:54:26Z,2024-03-26T10:54:26Z,1,People please take my word the commercial was made that way to draw attention I watched the movie today <br><br>The man didn’t think god was real   And then he lied and had people believe he was god. But in the end he became a child of god after certain things happend to him. The movie has a powerful message about faith don’t judge a book by its cover you have to read it I promise it is not blasphemy like everyone is thinking the man who is saying and doing  blasphemy things will become a child of god and start spreading the word as a child of god in the end   The commercial is designed to gain attention but when you watch it you will se the beauty in the message it’s positive and powerful I suggest you watch it it DOES NOT goes against your religion I promise ✊🏾
@demetriusgarrett5822,2024-03-26T10:25:53Z,2024-03-26T10:25:53Z,0,I just watched it the movies is about a man who didn’t believe then he lied and called himself god for his personal gain and while doins so things happend and god showed him that he is real.  And turned a non believer into a child of God I thing everyone who is against the movie should watch it.  Never judge a book by its cover you have to read it man. Humans are small minded as hell I just watched it and it’s awesome with a strong message but to every super duper Christian in the comment sections it does not goes against your religion at all
@Tonken-r1u,2024-03-25T08:16:54Z,2024-03-25T08:18:31Z,0,Positive Movie with the clear message of REPENTANCE So many people talk about it without actually watching the film<br> I really ❤love it and help me to come back to the church 🛐 since all of us are sinners and REPENTANCE is the real message of this movie 🎬
@discoveryandimagination,2024-03-24T06:53:34Z,2024-03-24T06:53:34Z,0,As a Christian I love the message. Basically it says that ANYONE can be saved once they believe that Jesus is savior. <br><br>Those who actually watched it would know what its about.
@realidadeoculta,2024-03-23T11:11:16Z,2024-03-23T11:11:16Z,0,"I loved the film, it has comedy, yes, but it has dramatic parts and series, with a beautiful story about friendship, human value, etc. Furthermore, I consider this film more accurate than dozens of others about &quot;Jesus&quot;. Most films show a blond and white Jesus (which is historical manipulation). In this film, Jesus was black, which, according to many historians and archaeologists who analyzed skeletons, coincides with the truth. Jesus was a Palestinian Jew–not white.<br>The other &quot;Jesus white&quot; films never show the miracles, but this film used modern filming techniques and special effects, showed Jesus stopping stones in the air, etc. The black Jesus in this film is very identical to the computerized portrait that British forensic experts and Israeli archaeologists made. I liked. Also the way the Romans erected the cross (in the crucifixion) is the most realistic way, no other film showed it so realistically. The words that Clarence spoke to the humans gave the feeling that Jesus himself spoke through him. The film has beautiful messages and in some parts is historically realistic."

@makenziehollister8533,2024-03-21T17:37:19Z,2024-03-21T17:37:19Z,0,"Contrary to pouplar opinion. I initially thought this movie would be blasphemous and granted some parts are questionable but i actually thought it represented Jesus Himself very well and His nature accurately. I think that at the root of the movie though Clarence is a controversial character, he becames aware of his own blasphemous behavior and repents, becoming a believer.  It is easy to judge him and see him as rebellious, disrespectful etc. etc. but it isn&#39;t a complete representation of his character. He is also a lost soul, deeply searching for meaning and to be somebody. We cannot judge those outside the church with the same measurement we use to judge those in the church (1 Cor. 5:12) which is why when Jesus dies He forgives His enemies for not knowing what they were doing (Luke 23:24). Because they were ignorant and so was Clarence, as stated by many if the character, but the movie is about growth. In real life people do ignorant things; practice witchcraft, commit crimes, etc. But what this movie demonstrates to me and possibly to others is that God&#39;s love is so deep that He doesn&#39;t believe anyone is beyond redemotion and in the movie, He saw Clarence for who He was and not for what He did and I believe that is who Clarence would become after the ending. Just a point to consider."

I do like thwt they DO acknowledge Jesus as the Messiah in this movie. I dont like at all how they did this ending with him. What could have been a great way to end this was make him the thief that joined Jesus. I was really hoping thats how the ending could have been. But it is unfortunate they didnt.

@LopiMiles,2024-01-15T23:00:27Z,2024-01-15T23:00:27Z,1,Its the devil behind it... remember there is only one gospel and one jesus ...the devil knows this and he knows people are religious and think of Jesus highly so the devil will most of the time not try to convince you that jesus existed or that you should follow Him....all he will do is leave Jesus in the equation but change the doctrine of salvation or repentance or anything that makes man open up to jesus ... inotherwards he will tell a half truth...half truth/ half lie...the half truth is to hook you into it and the lie is to deceive you and trap you in a lie....its all about doctrine.. because he knows what you chose to beleive in is what you will live out in your life ...and this 5 percent nation trash is just that trash....number one and the most blasphemous teaching and why you should stay away from this trash false religion is that they beleive they are gods ...human beings beings being gods...and this is literally the original lie that lucifer used on the firsr human beings that if they ate the forbidden fruit in the garden they would be like gods...<br>Its the same lie that brought all of us into sin and the devils kingdom and its the same lie Lucifer is using with the 5 percenters and this trash movie ...go look up all the soo called 5 percenters from jay z to erykah badu and tell me which of them has repented of their wickedness and living a holy lifestyle....none of them ...look at the famous people in this organization and think of the satanic influence they have wielded with thier talents and gifts....these are the whose who of luicfers.satanic entertainment kingdom..people whose message has corrupted young minds especially black American lives ..<br>And on another note isnt it interesting that this blasphemous movie comes out at the same time as the lil  nas x satanic music ?..trust me ..its not a coincidence...the devil is after guallible souls and this is another net to trap peoples souls to drag them to hell using doctrines of demons ..think where this movie is coming from...which camp is it coming from ....its coming from the entertainment industry which if you haven&#39;t still yet got it its literally part of  Lucifer&#39;s kingdom in these last days

They have to face reality it’s all over the Bible and when God comes back we’ll just have to deal with it or end up with their forefathers.Hollywood screwed people up enough with ws movies about God. I would stay away from anything they produce<br>The only thing probably accurate about this is their skin colour and hair for once as everyone knows except ws and their stupidity.

When I think of these things what I realized is that family Customs have been removed because inflation means that both parents have to work to support a family leaving the millennial to be influenced by social media influencers that have a agenda to further grasp control of the future.

Additionally, he was an educator who taught a course called, &quot;The History of the Bible.&quot; He&#39;d start his class on day one, standing in front of the students, and he&#39;d begin to tear out pages of the Bible and throw them into a garbage can. Inevitably, a sizable number of students would walk out, but it never failed, His objective was to teach those who were solid in their religion, just as he was; After all, he was a person whom thousands came to to learn the ways of the religion. However, he stated that if you could not stand critique, or controversy, or a challenge to your belief system, or if you could not see past what he termed, &quot;the religiosity&quot; of your belief system, then you would not be able to stand his class. He would reiterate to those strong enough, courageous enough to have withstood the tearing up of the book, that this was not Church, this was a class designed to further develop your knowledge base, and increase your intellectual capacity. And if you cannot get past your personal beliefs, then, you know, you need to leave. That stated, this film is not for those who are so tied to their religion, that they can&#39;t even stand the fact that a &quot;movie&quot; and in this case, a &quot;fictional&quot; account of historical events, can be made to entertain, then they/you need to stay home, safely in your religious cocoon, and save yourself some grief.

@BeatchBall,2024-01-09T00:39:40Z,2024-01-09T00:39:40Z,0,"There are many ways I can view this film.<br>As a film enthusiast, the trailer seams confused as to what kind of tone it&#39;s trying to proclaim. I mean, is this film a comedy like &quot;Life of Brian&quot;, or some sort of historical drama?<br>As a promoter of racial equity, I&#39;m stunned that the population of first century Israel looks more like modern day Uganda. But considering all the Romans still look Caucasian, I&#39;m afraid it may be another attempt by modern Hollywood to paint all white people as evil.<br>As a lover of history, could someone explain where we have an account of a second Messiah?<br>And as a Christian, my question is, &quot;where the heck is Peter and Paul?!!&quot; Both of them delt with men who attempted to use God&#39;s Church for personal gain. So why the heck aren&#39;t they confronting this guy?<br>In the end, this is the most time I will be giving this film."

Self righteousness is blinding some from reading the part that clearly says many wanted the influence Jusus had and this is story about one of those fakers who will probably get saved by the end.

Even if it turns out to be a funny movie, the premise of a guy scamming people out of money by pretending to be Jesus is not good. Even at that alone, Jesus would not be pleased. We&#39;re talking about a guy, Jesus, that flipped the tables in the temple because he was overcome with anger at the pharisees. So if this was around that time, I take it that had Jesus seen him, it would not have been nice. Most likely he would&#39;ve been scolded and rebuked. If any had read the Bible they&#39;d know that Jesus was just, not all loving, but just. He was angry at times, he was forthcoming, and he called out sin all the time."

There’s another trailer that shows a part in the movie where it looks like Jesus shows up to save Clarence and I’m assuming it’s because they find out he is a false prophet and/or professing to be Jesus. It actually seems like it is shedding a light on those who exploit Jesus/Christianity for personal gain and speaks even more to the grace and mercy the Lord extends to all of his children. Some may still call it blasphemous because it may contradict the Bible and they are mixing biblical/Christian themes with secular themes/music. Either way, it looks like a decent movie."

But he’s doing it to gain followers and become rich and known, even at the end of the trailer you can see that the wannabe starts to believe in Jesus (there were even people who faked to be the Messiah-so what is there to be mad about?) . Also some Christians believe in there fanfic white Jesus and fanfic black Jesus when he was clearly a brown man. He was brown as the common middle eastern man, you’d think it would self explanatory right. Even others in the comments and sub comments are proving he’s a brown man. All in all this movie is suppose to be a fun watch showing how the life if a non believer turning into a believer (the skin color war shouldn’t matter), idk why people are bringing all these notions and even saying, “I’ll pray for you”, “forgive them father for they don’t know what of they do”."

First, the main character is a con man from the start. I’m not sure whether he learns his lesson or if this is a Breaking Bad situation where the villain is the main character. Page also said that the casting seems to be an artistic choice in order to show how bigoted the Romans were towards Christians and Jewish people. For example, every historical record that we have of Pilate highlights his brutal antisemitism."

It’s all just a ploy to give black people a sense of entitlement and pride and those who don’t support the movie to be called racists. And common Jay-Z the man who calls himself Hova AKA jehova imo this character Clarence shows how he feels about God

Then I look around my city, and teenagers are vandalizing and stealing property right and left.

People dislike the movie but I think it add a layer of perspective… y’all don’t think people saw the acts of Jesus and what came with it and was like man that’s cap I am going to portray that to my benefit…. In the book of exodus we see Pharaoh uses magicians and tries to minimize Gods powers through Moses ? What’s the difference between the magicians and what clearances represents? <br><br>Point being I definitely think things like this probably really took place during biblical times… if not why kill Jesus ?

@MSBowen-pk6ww,2023-09-16T04:03:44Z,2023-09-16T04:03:44Z,0,So ya anyone else know about how over and over we are warned not to change the Bible period! This means do not add or remove! This is adding and altering in so many ways. I refuse to support this clear cash grab! No Jewish person was black this is a false cult started by a black slave in America. It claims that all white people will be damned and that JEsus only came for blacks. The facts are that this is not true. Jesus did not come for skin tone he came for the sin of the heart! So it is not a skin condition but a sin condition!
