They are past 50, and they don&#39;t reflect the characters I played in the video game. There are so many actors out there to choose from that fit into the original games character. Come on !"

Dialogue is child based not appropriately based off the game, actors don&#39;t fit the made up roles, claptrap should&#39;ve been voiced by his original voice actor from the games not Jack black although he&#39;s somewhat suiting for that role, it&#39;s overall an extreme disappointment.

I realize in this day and age, MILFS and GILFS sell to the youth, with misplaced attachment issues, but you think they could find someone a bit younger?  Kevin Hart!?  Why must writers always think adding diverse characters to a specific character somehow makes the movie better.  Can a movie ever be made without forced or overwritten diversity?  Did the makers of this movie even play the games?"

I do not mind for choice of actors, Kevin Heart, Black, others, i liked them, although Cate Blanchett is little old for playing Lilith, still setting of games is always crazy, full of surprises and funny and i loved all of them (with exception of B3, i simply cant stand Calipso twins). But this is garbage. I expected they will made movie that follows games, at least first game, what we got, bad, truly bad. I wish someone immediatley reboot this movie and made new one with proper setting following the story of the first game!"

@СергейАкимов-ъ9р,2024-10-05T07:46:08Z,2024-10-05T07:46:08Z,0,"Надо всегда говорить ПРЯМО. ВСЁ ИСКУССТВО: КИНО, ТЕАТР, МУЗЫКА, КНИГИ, ПОЭЗИЯ, имеет ИСКЛЮЧИТЕЛЬНО ДВА ГЛОБАЛЬНЫХ СМЫСЛА, либо служит ПРОСЛАВЛЕНИЮ БОЖЬЕГО СЛОВА, либо дьяволу. Служить БОЖЬЕМУ СЛОВУ это значит, каждым КАДРОМ, РЕПЛИКОЙ, КУПЛЕТОМ и т.п. &quot;ПРИВОДИТЬ&quot; НАС, ЗРИТЕЛЕЙ, СЛУШАТЕЛЕЙ к ПОКАЯНИЮ, СПАСЕНИЮ ДУШИ, и соответственно наоборот, максимально удалять от него. <br><br>МЕРЗКОЕ сатанинское КИНО. ДЬЯВОЛЬСКАЯ НАСМЕШКА, а ПОЧЕМУ надо понимать следующее. НО СНАЧАЛА. Любое НЕ УПОМИНАНИЕ(где бы то ни было) об Отце нашем небесном, подарившим для наших душ жизнь вечную, которая может испытывать такую блаженственную радость, но мы сами не хотим этого своей греховной жизнью, И также любое УПОМИНАНИЕ О БОГЕ в фильме ВСУЕ(что значит обращения к Богу без молитвы и благовейного состояния), И СЛОВА ЛЮБОВЬ, потому что Бог есть Любовь, ВСЁ ЭТО обычное БОГОХУЛЬСТВО(ХУЛА на ДУХА СВЯТОГО), самый страшный грех если прельститься. НО БОГА ОБИДЕТЬ НЕ ВОЗМОЖНО ОН БЕССТРАСТЕН, А вот ХУЛА ЕГО это БОЛЬШОЙ ГРЕХ. А ГРЕХ это РАНА которую человек наносит прежде всего сам СВОЕЙ ДУШЕ. РАНА которая ОТКРЫВАЕТ ДУШУ ДЛЯ ДЕМОНОВ мучителей, БЕСОВ ПОРОЧНЫХ СТРАСТЕЙ, слуг дьявола. Сам же ФИЛЬМ НАМЕРЕННО «РАЗЖИГАЕТ», но В ДУШАХ самих ЗРИТЕЛЕЙ, действие множества страшных ПОРОЧНЫХ СТРАСТЕЙ таких как, ЛУКАВСТВО, ГОРДЫНЯ, ЗАВИСТЬ, ТЩЕСЛАВИЕ(ПАГУБНАЯ СТРАСТЬ К ЛЮДСКОЙ СЛАВЕ), ЧЕЛОВЕКОУГОДИЕ, ГНЕВ, НЕНАВИСТЬ, МЕСТЬ, НЕМОЩЬ, ПОХОТЬ, БЛУД, СТРАХ, И пагубную СТРАСТЬ К всякой БЕСОВЩИНЕ. И ВОТ ТАК, ОГРОМНОЕ БОЛЬШИНСТВО ЛЮДЕЙ (не понимают), и ВОЛЬНО ИЛИ НЕ ВОЛЬНО СОГРЕШАЮТ(не вольно значит что, грех только у себя в уме, под действием той или иной порочной страсти, является таким же грехом), И ДЬЯВОЛ «ВВОДИТ» В ДУШУ человека ДЕМОНОВ МУЧИТЕЛЕЙ разных ПОРОЧНЫХ СТРАСТЕЙ. Ну А «ОБЩЕНИЕ» человека в жизни С любым собственным ДЕМОНОМ, «ПРИВЕДЁТ» рано или поздно только к одному, или К ПСИХИЧЕСКОМУ РАССТРОЙСТВУ, или УБИЙСТВУ, или САМОУБИЙСТВУ. И к АДУ для ДУШИ после физической СМЕРТИ тела. И что ещё имеет смысл в этом фильме. В фильме зашифровано как происходит мучение души живого человека демонами мучителями разных порочных страстей. И вот как БЫЛО БЫ ХОРОШО, ЧТОБЫ КАЖДЫЙ зритель ПОНИМАЛ это.  НО ЭТО всё очень «глубокие» моменты, ПОНЯТЬ которые МОЖНО будет ТОЛЬКО ЧИТАЯ, И ГЛАВНОЕ, ИЗУЧАЯ КНИГУ ЖИЗНИ, СВЯТОЕ ЕВАНГЕЛИЕ.<br><br>Да и ПОРОЧНЫЕ СТРАСТИ это ГОРДЫНЯ, ТЩЕСЛАВИЕ, ЛУКАВСТВО, СЕБЯЛЮБИЕ, ТРУСОСТЬ, ЧЕЛОВЕКОУГОДИЕ, ЗАВИСТЬ, ЖАДНОСТЬ, ОСУЖДЕНИЕ, АЛЧНОСТЬ, СКУПОСТЬ, СРЕБРОЛЮБИЕ, ЛИЦЕМЕРИЕ, УНЫНИЕ, ЧРЕВОУГОДИЕ, ГНЕВ, РЕВНОСТЬ, ВОРОВСТВО, РАЗДРАЖЕНИЕ, ВЛАСТОЛЮБИЕ, ПОХОТЬ, ЛЮБОПЫТСТВО, ПЬЯНСТВО, КУРЕНИЕ, ПРЕЛЮБОДЕЯНИЕ, ОБИДЧИВОСТЬ, ЗАСТЕНЧИВОСТЬ, ХИТРОСТЬ, РАССЕЯННОСТЬ и т.д. и т.п. И у КАЖДОГО ЧЕЛОВЕКА своя(СТРАСТЬ), так сказать, ЛИЧНАЯ. И ЭТО всё БОЛЕЗНИ, но БОЛЕЗНИ ДУХОВНОГО ПЛАНА.<br><br>А ПОЧЕМУ мы ВСЕ БОЛЬНЫ. После ГРЕХОПАДЕНИЯ АДАМА и ЕВЫ они были ИЗГНАНЫ ИЗ РАЯ. ДО грехопадения они ЖИЛИ В РАЮ подобно АНГЕЛАМ. После, БОГ одел их в «одежды» что значит в тела, и ДАЛ ЗАПОВЕДЬ «ПЛОДИТЕСЬ и РАЗМНОЖАЙТЕСЬ» и заселяйте Землю. НО для размножения, В ПОЛОВЫЕ ОТНОШЕНИЯ ПРИХОДИЛОСЬ ВСТУПАТЬ БРАТУ С СЕСТРОЙ. И ЭТО было вызвано необходимостью а НЕ ПОХОТЬЮ. И ВОТ ПОЧЕМУ КАЖДЫЙ рождающийся ребёнок уже ГРЕШЕН.  Только не физическое(физическое если вызвано похотью, между родными братьями и сёстрами), а так называемое ПЕРВОРОДНОЕ (ДУХОВНОЕ , ПРИЧИНА которого ГРЕХОПАДЕНИЕ) ПОВРЕЖДЕНИЕ(ГРЕХ, ПОРОЧНАЯ СТРАСТЬ) НА КАЖДОМ человеке при рождении. И У КАЖДОГО человека своя СОБСТВЕННАЯ СТРАСТЬ. И ЭТО БОЛЕЗНЬ, но БОЛЕЗНЬ прежде всего ДУХОВНОГО ПЛАНА.  И именно ПОРОЧНЫЕ СТРАСТИ людей являются ПРИЧИНОЙ ВСЕХ БЕД, СТРАДАНИЙ, и РАЗРУШИТЕЛЬНЫХ ДЕЙСТВИЙ на Земле. А вот условия ОСВОБОЖДЕНИЯ ОТ этого ПЕРВОРОДНОГО ГРЕХА(ПОВРЕЖДЕНИЯ, СТРАСТИ) как раз и ЗАПИСАНЫ в КНИГЕ ЖИЗНИ, СВЯТОМ ЕВАНГЕЛИЕ. НО СНАЧАЛА , чтобы донести их людям,  сам СЫН, БОГ СЛОВО ВОЧЕЛОВЕЧИЛСЯ(ИИСУС ХРИСТОС, имя ИИСУС означает СПАСИТЕЛЬ). А ЕГО за это РАСПЯЛИ. Но ОСТАЛОСЬ СВЯТОЕ ЕВАНГЕЛИЕ. Вот ЭТО и есть БОЖЕСТВЕННЫЕ УСЛОВИЯ , во первых ИЗБАВЛЕНИЯ ОТ ПЕРВОРОДНОГО ГРЕХА(а правильней сказать от ПОВРЕЖДЕНИЯ), И во вторых ДЛЯ СПАСЕНИЯ ДУШИ человеческой, ПОЛУЧЕНИЯ ЖИЗНИ ВЕЧНОЙ для ДУШИ, ПОСЛЕ физической СМЕРТИ тела , В ЦАРСТВИЕ НЕБЕСНОМ.<br><br>И поэтому ИСТИННАЯ ВЕРА В БОГА, в первую очередь ЗАКЛЮЧАЕТСЯ В «БОРЬБЕ» каждого ЧЕЛОВЕКА, ПРИ ЗЕМНОЙ ЖИЗНИ, СО своими собственными ПОРОЧНЫМИ СТРАСТЯМИ, И только ТАК можно получить СПАСЕНИЕ для своей ДУШИ.<br><br>Ну И ЕСЛИ каждый человек захочет &quot;БОРОТЬСЯ&quot; СО своими ПОРОЧНЫМИ СТРАСТЯМИ, ТО для начала, НУЖНО ПОВЕРИТЬ В БОГА, ПРЕСВЯТУЮ ТРОИЦУ: ОТЦА(СОЗДАТЕЛЯ ВСЕГО ЖИВОГО И НЕ ЖИВОГО, ВИДИМОГО мира и НЕВИДИМОГО),через СЫНА БОГА СЛОВО(ИИСУСА ХРИСТА), СВЯТОГО ДУХА. <br><br>А ЧТОБЫ  &quot;ПРИЙТИ&quot; к БОГУ или ПОЗНАТЬ БОГА необходимо ПОКАЯНИЕ.  <br><br>Ну А для того ЧТОБЫ ПОНЯТЬ ВСЁ что ЗАПИСАНО выше, И для ИСКРЕННЕГО ХРИСТИАНСКОГО ПОКАЯНИЯ, которое необходимо УСПЕТЬ(потому что ВРЕМЕНИ у каждого человека его земной жизни осталось очень МАЛО, придёт СМЕРТЬ, И ВСЁ )СДЕЛАТЬ ПРИ ЗЕМНОЙ ЖИЗНИ ЧЕЛОВЕКА, ПЕРВЫМ &quot;шагом&quot; будет (и как об этом уже упоминалось выше) ЧТЕНИЕ и ГЛАВНОЕ, ИЗУЧЕНИЕ КНИГИ ЖИЗНИ, СВЯЩЕННОГО ПИСАНИЯ НОВЫЙ ЗАВЕТ. ✋🏻"

Like I wouldn&#39;t mind but there&#39;s not exactly a lack of ideas given everything going on in the world right now. Instead of obsessive marketing trying to make films that on paper they think everyone would love, they should stick to making films the people making said films love. Marvels films expanded on an existing franchise, if producers went out on a limb and took a risk, they wouldn&#39;t need to rely on other franchises, they could make their own, but they are too greedy. <br><br>They treat investing in ordinary business as charity so I don&#39;t even want to know how they view the arts! Really stupid and short sighted of them to be honest, but then again I guess in 2024 when there are easier, completely unregulated ways of making money that requires less risk and less management, of course they are going to be selfish and take that option. It&#39;s exactly why government needs to step in, because they will continue to make horrible investments unless prevented from doing so. Investors couldn&#39;t give a toss about creating jobs or art or even products for people. If they could they&#39;d rather all sit in Singapore ripping each other off on their speculative assets, leaving everything else to rot."

But then I was disappointed, for once I love the actual critics on Rotten Tomatoes… They gave this 10% and the audience gave it 53%… How pathetic. 😂</b><br><br><br><br><b>For starters, Kevin Hart’s role should have been given to the likes of Terry Crews or Idris Elba, hell even Michael B Jordan would have been better. Cate Blanchettes character is not only supposed to be like a badass waifu (which this is not), but she’s also not supposed to be played by a Woman in her 60’s… Then instead of Mordecai or Brick, they add in Krieg and Tiny Tina as the other 2 in the main cast… If all of that’s not pathetic enough, look at the side characters they went and got decent sized actors for in Jack Black, Bobby Lee and Jamie Lee Curtis… All of that and it flopped, and do ya’ll know why? Because it didn’t stick to the source material. Just like that deadbeat playing Snow White, if you have an issue with the original story because “it’s from a long time ago and it’s problematic”, then you shouldn’t appear in them. You can’t talk down on an ALREADY MADE story, perform in a new pile of garbage that keeps the original name but with a completely different story and then when it fails you say “??? are evil!”. The new Snow White will flop, just like almost every other Live Action (which should have been all, but there are delusional morons who exist). 😂</b>"

How about little mermaid remake or my favorite is yet to come where Captain America actually has loyalty to Africa and has the most powerful special power of all time.....being black! How about the Acolyte or how about every movie or series in the past 5-10 years and probably will go on forever of  casting like they did for all the Star wars trash in the past 10 years! I love how the Boyz is completely going like that as well! My point is this cast is way better than 100s of things out there. So it could be worse!Pretty much everything is ruined until white guys grow a pair and stop this nonsense and we cast the proper fit and best talent for a part! I cant wait until Black Popeye comes out! We better be living in a sim and this us just a nightmare!!!!

@GreenDragon735,2024-09-04T09:48:30Z,2024-09-04T09:48:30Z,0,Were to start I just watched the borderlands movie the cast was recruited from the local nursing home blanchete and Curtis one of the worst things in the movie tiny tina wasn&amp;#39;t insane she was sane very boring everything was wrong with her backstory nothing like the games and one of my favourite characters from the games flushed down the toilet Bite size Roland was awful it&amp;#39;s Kevin hart playing himself as in every other movie he&amp;#39;s in nothing related to the games would off been better casting Terry Crews would be more authentic. I didn&amp;#39;t mind Jack Black as claptrap It&amp;#39;s disgraceful to call this dull mess a borderlands movie the setting of it felt more like a very cheap B movie it&amp;#39;s like the director and writers had never played the games just looked at the back cover of the game box and said that&amp;#39;s good enough. Aside from the cast and everything else this movie wasn&amp;#39;t made for fans of the games it was made for absolutely knowone would of thought RANDY PITCHFORD wouldn&amp;#39;t have sold out and he&amp;#39;d had some sort of creative input and would of actually made a borderlands movie for fans based on the games and not make one of the worst video game movies ever made disgraceful I would recommend that fans of the games don&amp;#39;t watch this train wreck of geriatric dull sanity.<br><br>Why was none of the original vault hunters in the movie they could of used Brick and Mordecai this would of added some depth it&amp;#39;s just over an hour and 40 minutes I&amp;#39;ll never get back I&amp;#39;m a fan of the borderlands games well except the woke mess of borderlands 3 my opinion of borderlands has gone down quite a bit I guess I&amp;#39;ll have to wait for borderlands 4 to see if the franchise can be redeemed?

(JLC overacting didn&#39;t help either) The story doesn&#39;t pick up until almost the middle and the final act is drawn out a little too much. That said it&#39;s not a badly made movie, just not sure who it was made for. It&#39;s seems like it was supposed to be a first in a series of movies to collect vault hunters for a super team kind of flick but idk it never really got that interesting."

Acting is solid.. if as an original character, but this? my god, a serious insult to the fans. Im a casual gamer, even I feel insulted. Too bad hollywood opting for a quick cash grab rather than doing an original production. Theres two plus though, theres no woke or dei propaganda and jack black as cl4ptrap"

I&#39;m not sure about that—I just can&#39;t picture him playing a tough guy since he’s usually the comic relief. The other characters don’t seem to have much chemistry either. And Cate Blanchett, though talented, seems a bit too old for the role. Maybe they could have gone with a younger actress like Scarlett Johansson? Just my opinion.</i>"

Well, the robot was the cool one.<br><br>I mean, the production set, special effects and everything, is very good. But that is just about all. It is also trying to be funny, but it ain&#39;t.

Hollywood again trying to profit off of gamers yet totally unconcerned with what we like about the game itself. Happened with Halo and now this.<br><br>I know everyone hates that Kevin Hart is playing Roland and believe me, I really hate it too, but Jack Black as ClapTrap is worse. I feel like any time there&#39;s a funny animated character, Hollywood goes right to him no matter what. That or they only cast him as ClapTrap because his name almost rhymes with it and that&#39;s it. His voice is really weird on ClapTrap and it feels terrible. And the actress playing Lilith? Jesus Christ, she looks terrible and she sounds more like a man than she does Lilith. Lilith was a hot badass chick that can blow shit up.

The movie will probably make a bit at the box office and Lionsgate will think they did a good job, but really, they should have got actors who have actually played the games and relate to the characters than try to assemble a star studded cast of actors who are typically typecasted already. They are good actors - don&#39;t get me wrong, but their range just isn&#39;t there.<br><br>They also forget that many of the people going to watch these films have put in HUNDREDS or even THOUSANDS of HOURSs into the base material, so to suddenly have someone that doesn&#39;t or can&#39;t pull off the character is really really jarring - even for something you&#39;re only going to be watching for an hour or so. <br><br>So yeah, the director and the casting director are huge Ls.

On what planet did they think it was going to go well 😹<br><br>You’re supposed to release a teaser a year before release, trailer 2 six months before release, trailer 3 three months before release. This isn’t a video game like Halo or COD, it’s a video game with a CULT FOLLOWING. <br><br>So to absolutely market this like Jumanji with mainstream actors and internet personalities, was far too cocky and lazy. They thought “let’s give gamers a movie they want and let’s carbon copy Jumanji!”<br><br>I’m so sick of seeing Kevin Hart in every single movie like this, can we miss him a little please? Sheesh.<br><br>Cate should have been Moxxi. Lilith is not an older woman she’s 20’s-30’s solid. <br><br>And Bobby Lee? Really? Just because his Internet personality is doing well doesn’t mean we want to see him in this movie.<br><br>I blame the producers for rushing this project. You shouldn’t rush a project when it’s a cult game with a cult fan base. Pure idiocy. This is why they need to sit down with real gamers who played the first Borderlands and 2/3. They thought they were making easy money and thanks to that flying too close to the sun mentality we now have a flop that could have been amazing. They should have had a mix of a younger and seasoned cast. <br><br>Jamie Lee as the Doctor? Are you fkn kidding me? The Doctor looks more like Rachel Weisz if anything. BIG missed opportunity there acting as if the Doctor is a 60-70 year old woman. 💀"

Genuine question.<br>Granted, I never played the game, (I&#39;m blind so can&#39;t, if anyone wants to ask me how I typed this, go ahead and reply, I&#39;ll reply to your questions).<br><br>Truth time, I tend to be a very optamistic person with a pretty sunny outlook, and I get that isn&#39;t a popular way to be in 2024, but I&#39;ve been on this road so long and I&#39;d rather have that than hop onto a different path. But I&#39;ve always tried to give a movie a chance, where I could, basing my judgements on the material&#39;s own merrets. I know this isn&#39;t ever going to get me a job reviewing movies, but still. Having watched the movie once, I can honestly say I loved it. The humour was pretty on point though could&#39;ve been dialled back a bit, and the characters were fun and entertaining. Can&#39;t comment on the CGI etc, because read above, am blind, but the sound affects, musical scores, and acting didn&#39;t make me pick up my pop corn and walk out, so it gets a solid 6 out of 10 for me, probably 6 approaching 7 because yes, I am that nice a person.<br><br>And this is how much I liked it, I will watch it again the next chance I get. <br><br>TLDR- Never gonna get a job as a nice guy movie reviewer."

Kevin Hart as Roland? Roland is one of the most serious characters in BL and they choose to let the small funny dude portray him? Jack Black? JB could have so many great fitting roles in BL, fuck I would&#39;ve even taken him as a male version of Ellie. Moxxi is too old aswell. At least give them proper Borderlands-ish make-up. Or just animate the thing altogether.<br><br>Edit.: I wonder if there&#39;s a single person who worked on this movie that actually has played BL. I strongly doubt it."

@squirrelattackspidy,2024-08-17T02:20:10Z,2024-08-17T02:24:09Z,0,I hate when the company that made the trailer needs to tell the people when the trailer starts.  Was I asleep 1 second before I clicked on the play button?  The script writers basically have a template they used for all the guardians of the galaxy movies and then just changed the characters and plot.  And every one of the characters they cast except for Tiny Tina is too old for the part.

Also, Kevin Hart is way too small to play Roland. Roland&#39;s role was never comic relief and always serious. Lilith is not suppose to be the age of someones grandma, and they cast a Mexican to play Tiny Tina lmao. I swear, you just can&#39;t make this crap up 😂. Why is accuracy always so problematic to these these ppl? They avoid it like the plauge. <br><br>What a perfect recent example of why Hollywood is dead. Instead of a simple accurate portrayal of a beloved IP they have to try and re-invent the wheel and piss off the only ppl that want to watch it in the 1st place. THE FANS. Yes, contiune to piss off your customer base until you have no more customers. Makes perfect sense! Can&#39;t see how you could fail"

Im sure im not alone in that. The reason the games are sooo popular and loved is because the writing and characters are top notch. Its a crazy offbeat raunchy post apocalyptic world. Filled with the most crazy unique characters in gaming. And the best they can muster is this campy, kiddy, version of it.

@phousefilms,2024-08-15T02:00:14Z,2024-08-15T02:00:14Z,1,"Heard how shitty this was already and how the director is Feig&#39;ing it(I call it that, where the director blames the audience for the movie being crap, like Paul Feig&#39;s &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;. Feig&#39;ing also works for &quot;MIB:International&quot;and Elizabeth Banks &quot;Charlie&#39;s Angel&#39;s&quot;).  <br>Watching this trailer, it gets the characters so wrong. Roland is supposed to be the straight man, Lillith is a grandma(and Cate Blanchett&#39;s face may be frozen with botox, but she can&#39;t pull off playing a young woman)but video game Tiny Tina would not be screaming at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU_NKNZljoQ&amp;t=66"">1:06</a>, she would be demanding to go through again. Shows I know the character better than the director."

@MrWashu12,2024-08-15T01:57:44Z,2024-08-15T01:57:44Z,0,Borderlands trailer for me what could have been moxxie does very little for the game glad she is here however just feels out of place Lilith ha great screen time however hair like wig and age of the actress does not match well for me to the director for bringing a game to life on the movie screen thank you but try again aeon flux and ghost in the shell had there issues but at least the two women playing the roles of the characters looked the part good story and endings here on borderlands i feel was rushed random planning agenda.

They did a great job in every way-its very entertaining and every actor actually completely lived up to their role and did a great job. It&#39;s not the typical roles that those actors are cast for-but they actually all completely stepped up and brought it-and they were great!! It&#39;s the best movie I&#39;ve seen in years.

I think that if someone is going to make a video game into a movie they should have to actually play the game and understand the characters before they shit out something like this

Only thing it does better than my asshole is spew unwanted waste into the world.<br><br>Goddamn, poor actors.  Love all those people I ain&#39;t holding it against them at all.  They became the janitors of Hollywood and had to try to clean up and present a shitty script to the world.<br><br>So here&#39;s what we actually need.  Whoever did the costumes, set pieces, hair, makeup, ok lets be honest, ANYONE THAT WASNT THE DIRECTOR/WRITER, they all did great, but directors/actors/writers get them out, get the current actors out, ALL of them coz whoever did casting is obviously some hollywood schlog&#39;s kid being &#39;handed opportunities&#39;.  Yeah, those actors are all talented.  No, they aren&#39;t the talent you need.  Like using a paperclip to change a tire.  That&#39;s not what it&#39;s for.  The fact the casting crew/director doesn&#39;t know how to utilize the tools they have or bring the right tools to the job are on THEM, not the actors.  Director/casting crew really just stuffed a bunch of fucking crayons in their tool belt and tried to build a house."

I honestly just wanted to walk out, but after paying good money for the goddamn ticket,  I made myself stick it thru.    It was awful.   The casting sucked for starters.  You have a 50+ year old granny playing Lilith,  a character meant to be about 20 years younger.   Kevin Hart doesn&#39;t fit his character at all either,   he would have better as ClapTrap.   Speaking of Claptrap,  Jack Black is fine as a voice actor,  but the character just got annoying after being funny at first.   Piece of shit movie.  0/10 .   Not even a 1."

I love fantasy movies, and characters in these movies used to be believable in their own world. Characters in fantasy movies nowadays feel like very fictional characters that try to belong to their fictional worlds, which is such a shame. The most impressive thing is casting Cate Blanchett as a badass main character. A lot of people hate it, but I find it very inspiring.

He sounded like Krieg from the game, they did a great job with his appearance in the movie, and Marcus was also done well too! Sounded and looked very similar to the game, but overall  the cast and the plot definitely lacked and it’s disappointing to see a really neat movie like this get trashed but- the casting was definitely not great and while I love Hart, he was definitely not the right choice for Roland, and the fact David Eddings didn’t do claptrap hurt me as much as Charles Martinet not doing Mario ☹️ still a fun movie but it’s clear why it’s getting trashed."

Insane and teenage stupid are not the same thing at all.  I mean, come on that character is so popular that she got her own spin off stuff, so how?  Again, what were they thinking?  Did they have some kind of blackmail leverage over the cast to get them to do this movie?  Did they just want an excuse to show that the women are  still pretty even though they are aged well past where anyone cast for those rolls should be?  What were they thinking?"

To be honest it doesn&#39;t even feel like a proper borderlands movie it&#39;s like recycled stuff from some marvel movies mixed in with some other action comedy flicks. Even the majority of the comment section speaks for itself and I agree with the majority of them on this terrible movie. They should cancel this whole movie and make a proper Borderlands movie and start from scratch.

Kevin as Roland and Jack as Claptrap I can kind of see at least, but you couldn&#39;t have picked a younger actress as Lilith? I adore Cate Blanchett, but  Lilith is not a classy lady. She is a quippy, crass bounty hunter that has more power than she knows what to do with. I feel like Emma Stone would have been an easy fit here. <br><br>And where the heck are Brick and Mordecai? All you had to do to make the movie rock solid was type cast the main characters and let them have a field day on set. I am happy they tossed in Krieg at least, but I can&#39;t imagine a complete lunatic is going to be an easy role to sell for an entire movie.."

Is this a prequel, and if so why does the vault key look like Pandora&#39;s vault key? And if it is you mean to tell me they lost the key 2 times? You guys couldn&#39;t just follow the story of borderlands 2, but took all the loved characters from it? All bad, the only thing that seems ok is Moxie and that&#39;s not hard to do. Kevin I&#39;m sorry bro, but you aren&#39;t Roland. Trash cast, trash take. New this would be embarrassing, but this bad is down right pitiful.

You&#39;d save money and the fans would love it, and it&#39;s not like they needed any more star power.  Bizarre, JB is great, but he isn&#39;t Claptrap, sorry.  (nevermind the rest of the terrible casting, though I guess at least they didn&#39;t change the race or sexual orientation of any of the characters... they just made them all 30 years older for no reason at all.)"

Roland turns white later on in the storyline apparently, and grows taller. <br><br>Jesus did they think about what they were doing? Or did they just grab the most well known actors and ignore the other applicants that may have fit the role better in hopes it would draw enough attention to milk money from it. When they could just make it true to the original, making all the fans happy (the only people that truly care about it) which would save it entirely from being a box offce flop. <br><br>Sadly Hollywood is on so many exotic illegal drugs they cant even make coherent stories anymore. Their brains are rotting away with every snort of coke on their lunch breaks. Not a single good movie has been made by anyone since 2013. Its like the world went stupid and everything became resold bullshit and terrible live action versions of beloved cult gamer classics  that never follow the giant ass storyline theyre given because they hate reading, but love making shit up."

You just lost all the reason you have left to appease the people who actually played the game.

@sammipraul3446,2024-07-30T02:30:56Z,2024-07-30T02:30:56Z,0,"yall need to calm down and accept that movies these days are made to appeal to the masses, not niche audiences like us. they picked decent actors/actresses. jack black as claptrap is CLUTCH even tho the voice is different. get over it and watch a DVD if you can&#39;t handle modern movies cus they&#39;re all the same regurgitaded nostolgia. accept that and move on. i was so excited when i first noticced this movie and yall are just assholes in the comments. thanks for killing my happy :/"

But I wish she had something &quot;a bit more lore accurate&quot; like idk... siren powers.<br><br>I love how they respected Roland&#39;s character as the goofy black guy of the story. <br><br>Finding an antagonist for this movie must&#39;ve been hard...

How do you take an &quot;M&quot; rated game and turn it into a PG13 movie. It&#39;s like making &quot;Deadpool&quot; into an after school special.

@phantompyro6482,2024-07-25T20:01:24Z,2024-07-25T20:01:24Z,0,"People actually defendinf this trailer don&#39;t understand the point of movie adaptations. For the most part adaptations would bonb without fan backing, they may get some hype but it&#39;s unlikely. The fans of the franchise are what goad others into watching and trying the franchise, like with game-movie/show adaptations like FNaF and Fallout. They encourage new viewers to enjoy the series. This trailer is devoid of any of the charm of the original trilogy. The focus was on the goofy characters and the pooe casting and delivery of every line in this trailer shows me (and as the other comments show others) how little the producers knew about the Borderlands series. It knew how to be fun and lightheaded, but also how to take itself seriously when it came down to it. Also, Jack Black as Claptrap is nauseating, Claptrap is a derpy moron who&#39;s so deeply self absorbed that despite being a fairly physically weak (at least in B1 and B2) sees himself as a ruler. He bosses the player around because he&#39;s so enamored with himself and it&#39;s made funny and endearing because he has such a high pitched and whiny voice that shows how pathetic he actually is in comparison to his actions. Unless they make significant changes (which I doubt they will) they&#39;ll likely only receive hate watching views because other than the fanbase at its core this looks like a cheap version of Guardians of the Galaxy so those who aren&#39;t fans likely will take a pass on it"

If you&#39;re a returning fan, this just confuses the timeline and plot even more while bastardizing beloved characters and turning them into caricatures, and I can&#39;t imagine a new viewer finding interest in the concept of &quot;Borderlands but if it was just a slapstick comedy&quot; if you&#39;ve never found the game&#39;s interesting before.

Like actually like on par with something like the hitman movie or the tomb raider movie. Like the cast is completely wrong. Like the rock would&#39;ve fit better than Kevin hart since Roland was not a small guy at all! Lilith was very much a young hot person who had a shit ton of sass and this girl just doesn&#39;t match that at all. The kid is the most stereotypical &quot;adult&quot; kid i&#39;ve ever seen and manages to feel cookie cutter at best. Jamie lee curtis just doesn&#39;t match her character at all. Like why the hell did they only get people in there like mid 50s early 60s like wth. And JACK FUCKING BLACK!? Dude you act like the claptrap va is unavailable or someone who can do a good claptrap impression doesn&#39;t exist Jack black does not match Claptrap at all!!!!!!!!!!!

They ruined the last two games and made up for it by losing all sense of the story and making a Hollywood movie. &quot; You will enjoy &quot;. As a fan of the entire series, it died once they made the decision to do (Tales from the borderlands) instead of make a 3rd game or a movie back when the people knew what they wanted to happen next."

Claptrap is a beloved little mascot and now he&#39;s spoiled with Jack&#39;s political and social blindness.<br><br>Considering Claptrap is a voice acting role that&#39;s a double fuck up.<br><br>This would have been good if it was animated and had OG cast for voice actors. It would have been unstoppable in fact.<br><br>Idk why major companies don&#39;t like money. Just keep burning it like this."

They couldn&#39;t get Idris Elba or some other dude with the same physique to play him? Gina Gershon as Mad Moxie?! Come on guys! Moxie is like the epitome of hotness and yall went with a 62 year old?! No Zero? Salvador? Mordekai?  Ugh...Not looking good. But I guess we&#39;ll see.

Yes, the characters were vault hunters, so finding the vault should be important. However, the Borderlands games have fully developed characters and plots. This trailer looks like a generic action movie. Additionally, I am confused about the characters. Brick and Mordecai are essential characters to the franchise-- much more central than Tiny Tina or Kreig (even though those characters have a place too). And also, I don&#39;t know who the main villain is going to be, but I won&#39;t take this movie seriously if it is not Handsome Jack. The games spent so much time developing the character of Handsome Jack that it would be malpractice to exclude him in a movie adaptation."

I&#39;m just hearing about this now because I honestly never thought it would become a movie at this point but now I am reaaaaaaaally wishing it didn&#39;t become a movie. This is why video game movie adaptions fail so badly...because boomers sit in a room point at something popular and are like...we can totally movie that! The young 20-35 year olds will LOVE this because &quot;BoRdErLaNdS&quot; more like Retirelands because half of this cast should be in a nursing home.

Bruh you have Tannis, Lilith, and Moxxie all who are supposed to be late 20s early 30s and the youngest actress for them is 52 😂🤣 which isn’t bad except they hired actors that have never done roles somewhat like their characters. The girl that plays Tiny Tina is the same thing she doesn’t have the energy even to her voice to play her. You get Kevin Hart to play the badass Roland but mf is 3 feet tall on a good day plus a funny guy playing 1 of the least funny characters and why couldn’t you just get David Eddings or Jim Foronda to play ClapTrap. You know David the guy that did his in the series or Jim who did his voice for BL 2 VR. Twisted Metal and Fallout did good so why not capitalize on it by destroying a franchise instead…"

This is a step in the wrong direction I do not hate the people who are in this I think Kevin Hart is a really good actor and good person. I just wish he would be in better movies and honestly we need to just get rid of Randy if we can let’s boycott this for the sake of borderlands because this might be the death of the franchise. A franchise that has been in my life since I was in middle school. I’m now 22 this makes me sad to see the franchises that I love turned into a money grab. Fuck you Randy.

Tiny Tina should be a teenager, and by that I mean 13 or so, Roland should be mid 30s and a beef cake, Lilith mid 20s, Tannis in her 30s. Granted by BL3, Tiny Tina is already an adult, but Roland would have died years ago (in BL2). The opening scene suggests that they&#39;re coming to Pandora for the first time, in which case they wouldn&#39;t have met Tiny Tina. However, the info box suggests that they&#39;re returning to Pandora, in which case they would already know about all the vaults (and Roland would be no more).

He&#39;s a cool dude, absolutely, but come on... the director of quite disturbing movies like Hostel, it doesn&#39;t fit the borderlands vibe.

@HyphyJuice916,2024-06-24T23:40:28Z,2024-06-24T23:40:28Z,0,The fact that this movie is only PG-13 is going to hurt it so much as far as sales. Majority of the people who have played this game and are fans of it are well over 18. First game came out in 2009 and my cousin who was a couple years younger than me played it with me. It honestly just pisses me off because Deadpool proved that rated r movies can clearly bring in a mad I&#39;m amount of money. Yet these studios keep making these remakes and adaptions PG-13 and the movies end up sucking ass. Robocop is one of the best examples of this. Fans of the original did not like it.😊

Even if the trailer seems to be hiding the best (worst?) for the movie. <br><br>I live Jack Black but did they have to change Clap Trap voice for Black&#39;s clout?

@SmiercYT,2024-06-17T17:45:29Z,2024-06-17T17:45:29Z,1,"I don&#39;t want to just say something negative like everyone tends to do about every new media that comes out. Make a new game everyone complains, make a movie everyone cries. I think the movie looks good, and I think if the company got less backlash about the third game that game would have had the chance to grow into what borderlands 2 was and got more content. I actually think Kevin Hart is a decent pick for Roland, my thing is the rest of the cast clearly doesnt know their characters personality. This is extremely jarring if you played the games, even the script doesnt sound like a Tina line or Lilith line. But I have hope that this company will try to replicate the traction from the second game, I still play borderlands every day. I really hope they don&#39;t get discouraged and give a good effort for the new borderlands media to come. Like I said these are valid points I&#39;m trying to point out, not complain or jump on some hate wagon; looking forward to seeing this hope it turns out nice."

@jimmyjjohnson7135,2024-06-17T06:03:10Z,2024-06-17T06:03:10Z,0,My f*<b>***</b> god I think that what made borderlands 2 so good in terms of tone is even though it had so much comedy it was still horrifying when you killed enemies they had a chance to scream things bled and they use this as a part of the comedy there was a gun that literally shamed you for killing people with it and it was a joke I describe borderlands feel especially in terms of comedy is uncomfortable to laugh when Jack tells you how he ripped out someone&#39;s eye with a spoon and they proceed to run around flailing and hitting walls the game tells you this as a joke The goal is to make you laugh and the way that Jack says it it&#39;s kind of funny but you don&#39;t want to laugh because it&#39;s horrifying it&#39;s uncomfortable to laugh this is Jumanji I mean come on there&#39;s a reason they play short change hero in borderlands 2 do you think a high octane fun haha funny need guns shoot Dwayne Johnson Kevin Hart movie is any place for short change hero The one and only good thing about this movie that I have gotten from the trailer is the fact that it&#39;s non-canon since there&#39;s absolutely no possibility for this to happen. Jack Black deserved better he is arguably the perfect casting for claptrap even though claptrap does have a lot of things that I don&#39;t think Jack Black would be that good for you know like all the horrible things that he goes through but still this movie is just sad
@FR0_MAGNUM,2024-06-17T04:09:30Z,2024-06-17T04:09:30Z,0,"Terrible casting. Terrible interpretation of the games. This just screams of old men in suits who saw a game that was pretty successful and decided to absolutely bastardize it to make a movie. The sad part is that kate blanchett seems like the best part of it. And shes the one who is least like the actual character. This is going to be pure garbage and forgotten immediately. It sucks because videogame movies already have a horrible stigma. And this just adds to the idea that videogame movies dont work. Hollywood, stop casting like this! Get good actors who actually fit the godd*mn role, and stop ALWAYS casting recognizable names as characters they CANNOT represent appropriately. This is like Chris Pratt as f****cking Mario times 20. Embarrassing."

Now I can understand why so many ppl hate the casting and just the overall movie lol. The casting is way off. I don’t have a problem with the actors themselves but they are all wrong for the characters. Even claptrap’s voice is no bueno despite being voiced by JB and I love JB. Side note the game is pretty awesome.

Sadly...from the trailers I have seen it seems warranted!  I was hoping I was just feeling a certain way over poor casting choices and Roland being reincarnated (as comic relief mind you, given he was the calm and rational one) but they have completely missed the mark.  The trailers all seem lifeless and grasping for laughs/excitement for dear life while being absolutely lack luster.  Even if this was nothing more than a stand alone, it doesn&#39;t fit anywhere in the timeline and can&#39;t fit into the actual canon, which I think is great given it lacks the charm and charisma ( and story telling and humor, etc.) of the games.  So now let&#39;s assume it is a stand alone reimagining and hold it to that standard...from what I have seen the humor being used died off 7 years back and is no longer relevant ( or funny) and the cast is full of many great talents...that feel like they are phoning it in for a pay check and don&#39;t care at all about the content.  I love this group of talent, but what I am seeing is really making me question the validity of that, though I have never really gotten a positive  feel for cate blanchet in any of her roles, and furthering this with borderlands seems on point.  But when did borderlands enter the realm of equilibrium with gun katas&#39;? This just adds to the lack of borderlands vibes and the overall confusion."

Why is kreig here. Was that supposed to be handsome? Jack. Tiny Tina was the only thing passable. How did you not include scooter? Moxie also looked old. Do the people who made this genuinely hate the franchise and just wanted to dump all over it. You could have picked a handful of unknown actors and made this way better. Bollywood could have made this better. Pthumbs 👎👎

@coolwing449,2024-05-30T02:29:44Z,2024-05-30T02:29:44Z,0,"Ok, mis casting aside, and I agree with most of that… when I found out Kevin Hart was playing Roland, that felt really off until I saw the trailer, and then it was a huge wtf moment.   Correct me if I’m wrong, isn’t Roland the strong, deep voice, calm, calculating type… at least it’s how I remember him form BL2.  So who the… is this character played by Hart?  Not only does Kevin not fit the bill for my mind as Roland, the “Roland” in this movie seems to be some neurotic dufus.  I get the casting goof, but did the writers even play a single Borderlands game???<br><br>Funny that a director friend mentioned Hart and Black were both in Jumanji.  IMO, if they had just stared with the Jumanji cast, they’d have been a lot better from the get go.  Johnson as Roland, Anderson as Lilith, Black as Claptrap and Hart as… idk… Tiny Tina.<br><br>Fallout did it right!!!  It seems most people who love the game, love the series.  And… most importantly… a lot of people who know nothing about the game also love the series… because it was well done and has a great story.<br><br>I feel the producers of Borderlands are hoping to cash in mainly from those who don’t know the game.  In fact, I feel mostly those who would see casting mismatches are those who know the game.  However, alienate the core base of players, lose the hype, have a meh response… and… may be yet another video game to movie flop.  Assassins Creed anyone ???<br><br>For myself, love the games.  Have played most. Wonderlands was maybe my favorite, but I digress.  For myself, I was excited… then I saw the trailer… after which I had a little vomit in my mouth.  I have zero desire to pay full price and see this on the big screen.  Probably worth a $2 rental a few months after release.  Maybe go see it at the theatre on $5 Tuesday… maybe.  But if enough bad reviews come out… it may just be a pass.  Why watch something you love get crapped all over?   Do I hope the masses love it?  If it makes BL4 even better… sure."

The cast is so badly miscast. This group looks like the new Jumanji in a desert wasteland crew than the actual Borderlands characters. Then you see producers from Uncharted.. another horribly miscast movie that also failed in the box office.

Why the H did you cast Kevin Hart in that role?<br><br>I love Kate - truly - however why hire a 55 year old actress to play a 22 year old role? I mean even in Borderlands 3 she is 34 - and I&#39;m sorry but Kate - despite how insanely attractive she may be - will have a REALLY hard time passing for a 34 year old!<br><br>- OMG I can&#39;t there is so much wrong here ... Why is Jack Black Claptrap? I&#39;m pretty damn sure David Eddings would have been a whole lot cheaper - and he IS what most of us fans think of when you say Claptrap.

@Lodurrson,2024-05-23T00:17:33Z,2024-05-23T00:17:33Z,0,Making a Borderlands movie was always a bad idea. It’s like making a live action Rick &amp; Morty. The fan base has no idea what they even like about it. They just want to complain and pretend that they are one of the precious few who are smart enough to actually “get it”. Even if the movie is good they won’t give it a chance.

@ToxicallyMasculinelol,2024-05-22T08:27:19Z,2024-05-22T08:27:19Z,0,"They should have just made it an animated movie. What is it with the obsession with making everything live action? Borderlands works precisely because of its surreal, comically ridiculous style. It&#39;s not supposed to be like real life. Seeing real life people dressed up as bandits and psychos just makes me cringe. This is not a story that could happen in the real world. The casting for all the main characters is ridiculous too, but this whole thing is just fundamentally misconceived even before anyone hit the casting couch. It&#39;s actually a bad idea at rock bottom to make a live action Borderlands film. It should have been an animated film using the actual art style from Borderlands. Just a movie story similar to the cutscenes of the games, but with a higher budget and better writing. That&#39;s all they needed to do and it would have sold like crack. If it actually honored the universe (and particularly the style and humor of the most beloved game, Borderlands 2), players would eat it up. But instead it comes across like some studio executive who&#39;s never played Borderlands was flipping through a catalog of popular franchises they own or could cheaply license, and settled on Borderlands as a potential way to make a quick buck by capitalizing on the tired trend of live action remakes.<br><br>And it isn&#39;t even a sound financial decision, because these live action remakes are <i>not</i> the safe bets Hollywood execs seem to think they are. Because it worked for Disney a <i>handful</i> of times, they think a safe way to make money now is by turning any beloved franchise into a live action movie. But most of the attempts have been colossal flops. Only Disney was able to pull it off at the box office, and that has more to do with the huge recognition factor of the properties they succeeded with. When they tried it with less notable properties, it failed for them too. And Borderlands is not nearly as well known among normies (the &quot;moviegoing public&quot;) as The Lion King lol. So even if it was Disney producing it, this still would not have worked. But it&#39;s particularly for Borderlands because the whole concept of the Borderlands universe simply does not work in live action, and they would have known that if they had even played 10 minutes of the game or even just watched some cutscenes on YouTube. It&#39;s painfully obvious. But that&#39;s how you know this is a soulless cash grab: only a complete and utter shill, without even a passing familiarity with the games, looking for a quick buck off a live action remake, could have thought <i>Borderlands</i> of all things would be a good choice for live action.<br><br>And it really cuts to the heart of the creative bankruptcy of Hollywood, doesn&#39;t it? They are so terrified of risk, so frothing at the mouth for a <i>safe</i> dollar, that they would rather make a live action remake of Borderlands than fund the development of a new idea. If I might be so bold, I&#39;d argue this speaks to a general sickness in our culture, what some have termed &quot;safetyism.&quot; Usually it&#39;s in reference to a fixation on physical safety at the expense of everything else, but I think it extends to an extreme aversion to risk in general, a fear of any kind of noxious stimulus, including (perhaps especially) monetary loss. People never <i>wanted</i> to lose money, but they used to be willing to take a risk, if not for the love of art, then even just for the promise of greater reward. Now they&#39;d rather make maybe $15 million on a huge budget cash grab than make billions on the next Star Wars – and I don&#39;t mean the next <i>ripoff</i> of Star Wars (see Rebel Moon), simply aping the aesthetics and concept, rather than doing what actually made Star Wars successful: something actually original, something you couldn&#39;t see anywhere else (at the time), yet simultaneously something that channeled timeless human universals like the monomyth, the hero&#39;s journey, the worship of a higher power, love, family, redemption, etc.<br><br>There&#39;s an unlimited, truly infinite number of stories that could do the same thing Star Wars did, and Hollywood could easily pull one of them off if they just took a goddamn risk on something new, but they&#39;re too afraid of failure, too caught up in the promise of safe profit, that they&#39;d rather spend another $300 million not on doing what Star Wars did, but on aping how Star Wars <i>looked</i> on the surface. Frankly, it&#39;s depressing. I don&#39;t think this rut is permanent, but I don&#39;t suppose we&#39;ll see relief for many years. Perhaps a new generation will need to come along that can actually pick apart the defects in our overall culture, because this phobia did not arise in a vacuum, it splattered out of the bowels of mainstream, modern, western culture. To quote a truly great story: if we&#39;re looking for someone to blame, we need only look in the mirror."

She was hot in the 80s and I mean this in a literal sense. And Moxxi is supposed to be a buxom sexpot. I’m really not understanding the casting here. What’d they do, have a closed casting call where they just phoned about 20 actors? Casting’s saving grace is Jack Black. Nice choice there. With the voiceovers and scripts from the games, they really have to bring it to make it a movie. Just viewing the trailer it looks like they screwed the pooch on a Sunday morning livestream.

Kevin Hart should&#39;ve been the voice of Claptrap. Jamie Lee Curtis as Tannis is perfect. She has the experience to play a complex and eccentric character. Where are Brick and Mordecai? My pick for Mordy would be Colin Farrell. He can pull off the look, the attitude, and the charisma. For Brick, Dave Bautista, either as a voice actor or live. He&#39;s proven himself as Drax, but he&#39;s been decent in other movies."

@lukesteele9353,2024-04-25T15:48:37Z,2024-04-25T15:48:37Z,1605,"So, you cast a 65yo woman to play a 30 year old. You cast a 54 year old to play a 27 year old. You cast a 16 year old to play an 8 year old. You cast a short comedian to be a serious 6foot dude. Kreig is like 30 years too early. I have a feeling this isn&#39;t going to go down well with the true BL fans"

@captainrelyk,2024-04-24T22:15:54Z,2024-04-24T22:15:54Z,1,Everything about this movie looks great… except for the cast. The only actors who fit their characters is Ariana as tiny tiny and maybe jack black as claptrap… but why tf not just cast the original claptrap voice actor? It’d be cheaper and itd avoid the issue of jack black not entirely fitting claptrap.

Cast is awful on top of it. Krieg better set himself on fire. We don&#39;t know who the main villain is. It looks so genericly run of the mill pg-13. Borderlands should be rated R with dark humor. Well borderlands 1 and 2 were. 3 was playing safe so more ages can hate it and this movie is doing the same it seems. Making it safer so more ages can see it and hate it

They should&#39;ve at least gotten professional cosplayers that resemble the originals and properly represent the world of borderlands. I think jack black as clap trap is about the only decision that makes sense. And to not even do a handsome jack retelling is just a big f*ck you. Borderlands2 WAS the high point of the series. Ah well. At least we got the fallout series. That&#39;s about the best written and directed adaptation of a videogame that&#39;s been done to date. This&#39;ll probably get mediocre reviews and flop at the box office

@codysmith4076,2024-04-14T22:10:36Z,2024-04-14T22:14:55Z,0,As far as I know Kevin Hart has never died in a movie Roland dies in borderlands 2 is Kevin Hart going to die?? Another thing I&#39;m confused about some of the scenes in it make you think it&#39;s about borderlands 1 but there&#39;s characters from borderlands 2 ?? This movie going to be weird I&#39;m worried don&#39;t make the world hate one of my favorite video games series  and everyone else keeps saying this why is Lilith and Tanis so old  I&#39;m almost willing to bet they&#39;re going to have to redo this whole movie just like that company did with the Sonic movie
@DieHardAlien,2024-04-14T21:50:39Z,2024-04-14T21:50:39Z,1,I’ll just go right out and say I don’t mind the casting of Lilith and Tannis (especially with actresses like Cate Blanchett and Jamie Lee Curtis in the roles). <br><br>It’s Kevin Hart who feels the most miscast and out of place thus far. It really should’ve been someone like Wesley Snipes if the filmmakers wanted to straddle the line between being comedically outgoing (Borderlands) and  stoically serious (Borderlands 2).

Ver a unas envejecidas Blanchett y Jamie Lee Curtis en vez de darle brillo a la película le resta mucho. La Tiny Tina con orejas de conejo es de Borderlands 3. Ni siquiera pudieron buscarse al actor de voz de Claptrap. Borderlands la película no tiene nada de Borderlands el vídeo juego que tanto nos gustó.

@orikx4658,2024-04-12T21:19:47Z,2024-04-12T21:19:47Z,0,"I have so many problems with the film I don&#39;t know where to start. The casting is completely wrong. Lilith and Tannis are too old. At 54, Cate Blanchett is a good 20 years too old and Jamie Lee Curtis just shoots the bird. The woman is 65 years old, twice as old as Tannis in the comics and films! In the games and comics they are both in their 30s. At the time of Part 2, Lilith is 32 and Tannis is only a few years older. Maybe 2-3 years older. In the comics, Lillith sees Tannis as something of an older sister. Roland is too small and too funny. Roland has always been the dutiful, slightly brittle type. A bit like the teacher&#39;s favorite who keeps things tidy during breaks. He rarely cracked jokes and his interactions with others were always rather professional, with the exception of a few people Tina, Lilith, etc. In the comics, he was so stubborn and brittle that both LIlith and Maya broke up with him because of it. How to choose the class clown for this role. That does not fit. And yes, Kevin is just too small, even if I could ignore that. And there&#39;s so much more you could say about Tina. Tina is very crazy in both the games and the comics. Not just a little crazy, but ready for the slap Crazy. For example, the child has dissociative personality disorder, a little bit of ADHD and gigantic teaumata. In the comics she is so crazy that when she was 12 she was able to live among bandits for almost a year because everyone thought she was a female psycho. I think the film Tina is a little too... Healthy? And my biggest problem with Borderlands is. When does the film take place? We see war, after or at the end of the second part. In the trailer we see Mouthpiece and the costumes and the design is more based on the 3rd. The chamber that is to be opened is the one on Pandora from the first part, just like the chamber monster. The film cannot be arranged chronologically. It&#39;s like they just took a bunch of story elements from all the parts and made it into a film. The film will probably be good and funny for everyone who doesn&#39;t know Borderlands. For everyone who knows and loves Borderlands, the film will be a slap in the face. I&#39;m 100% sure about that."

@midwesternexplorer9339,2024-04-11T18:20:22Z,2024-04-11T18:20:22Z,0,Jack Black voicing Clap trap gave me Cancer.
@rjagger4766,2024-04-11T17:56:44Z,2024-04-11T17:56:44Z,0,They should have cast someone around 30&#39;s.

@JustinMertz-z8m,2024-04-11T11:41:45Z,2024-04-11T11:41:45Z,4,I can see what they&#39;re going for but it just doesn&#39;t work.<br>Casting fix:<br>Roland - Idris Elba<br>Claptrap - Kevin Hart<br>Lilith - literally  any woman who&#39;s played a lead under the age of 40<br>Tiny Tinas fine<br>Jack black as the narrator and torg and probably any other hero supporting character<br>Brick - Martyn Ford or vin diesel
