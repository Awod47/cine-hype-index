Hugh Grant was brilliant in the role, but the arguments and plans of the character he portrayed were unnecessarily complex and it didn&#39;t make sense considering his goal. It made the film unconvincing and incoherent. This could have been one of M Night Shyamalan&#39;s latest films as well. Still, Hugh Grant was good in his role."

@snehashispanda4808,2025-02-28T07:36:43Z,2025-02-28T07:36:43Z,1,"Monotheism causes ignorance, oppression, and violence. Monotheism is less pluralistic because monotheism stipulates that people pigeonhole their beliefs into one tenet. Monotheism is irreconcilable with the existence in our nature of the instincts of benevolence because it compels followers to devote themselves to a single Creator. Monotheism has been a &quot;totalizing discourse&quot;, often co-opting all aspects of a social belief system, resulting in the exclusion of &quot;others&quot;. The logic of monotheism yields little basis for tolerating other religions. Monotheism is described as the instigator of violence. The intolerance of narrow monotheism is written in letters of blood across the history of man. They invoke divine sanction for the cruelties inflicted on the conquered."

@sketchywav7741,2025-02-04T02:33:47Z,2025-02-04T02:37:20Z,1,"i know the movie was made with a certain message to get across but I feel like they fumbled a much more interesting premise with the guy finding a way to talk to god. Or a god. I had a feeling it would end the way it did but was hoping it wouldn&#39;t go the &quot;guy kidnaps girls to fulfill his power fantasy&quot; route because ive seen that twist a million times. The message was thought provoking, but man I was hooked when the girl died and &quot;came back to life&quot;"

@mh2bul,2025-02-01T09:12:18Z,2025-02-01T09:18:15Z,1,An intellectual thriller about control. Skip opening scene if watching with family. Only gore in second half and relatively tame. Whilst ending was anticlimactic the entire film does pose some very interesting ideas and shows that even mild mannered Hugh Grant can be a villain.
@mm.hellboy4151,2025-02-01T06:34:52Z,2025-02-01T06:34:52Z,2,Most of the religious shit they made up in movie is false information but people too lazy to research about it like the man in the film and come to a result.

Of the girls who are quickly falling in love with Islam? This film is to create doubt in the girls of the world. The ideology of pornocracy wants to create doubt in you girls with this film... Go and research deeply into Shiite Islam and contact Shiite authorities in Iran and ask the answers to your questions.... Ask yourself why the subject of the film is two girls??

Reiterations of the same ideology changes and alternate as the world does.<br>3. The cage scene can be compared to any element of structure (e.g., work, relationship..). <br>4. Questions should be asked for clarity <br>, theories and hypothesis should be tested.<br>5.

@СергейАкимов-ъ9р,2024-12-20T05:43:45Z,2024-12-20T05:43:45Z,0,"Надо всегда говорить ПРЯМО. ВСЁ ИСКУССТВО: КИНО, ТЕАТР, МУЗЫКА, КНИГИ, ПОЭЗИЯ, имеет ИСКЛЮЧИТЕЛЬНО ДВА ГЛОБАЛЬНЫХ СМЫСЛА, либо служит ПРОСЛАВЛЕНИЮ БОЖЬЕГО СЛОВА, либо дьяволу. Служить БОЖЬЕМУ СЛОВУ это значит, каждым КАДРОМ, РЕПЛИКОЙ, КУПЛЕТОМ и т.п. &quot;ПРИВОДИТЬ&quot; НАС, ЗРИТЕЛЕЙ, СЛУШАТЕЛЕЙ к ПОКАЯНИЮ, СПАСЕНИЮ ДУШИ, и соответственно наоборот, максимально удалять от него. <br><br>МЕРЗКОЕ сатанинское КИНО. ДЬЯВОЛЬСКАЯ НАСМЕШКА, а ПОЧЕМУ надо понимать следующее. НО СНАЧАЛА. Любое НЕ УПОМИНАНИЕ(где бы то ни было) об Отце нашем небесном, подарившим для наших душ жизнь вечную, которая может испытывать такую блаженственную радость, но мы сами не хотим этого своей греховной жизнью, И также любое УПОМИНАНИЕ О БОГЕ в фильме ВСУЕ(что значит обращения к Богу без молитвы и благовейного состояния), И СЛОВА ЛЮБОВЬ, потому что Бог есть Любовь, ВСЁ ЭТО обычное мелкопакостное БОГОХУЛЬСТВО(ХУЛА на ДУХА СВЯТОГО), самый страшный грех если прельститься. НО БОГА ОБИДЕТЬ НЕ ВОЗМОЖНО ОН БЕССТРАСТЕН, А вот ХУЛА ЕГО это БОЛЬШОЙ ГРЕХ. А ГРЕХ это РАНА которую человек наносит прежде всего сам СВОЕЙ ДУШЕ. РАНА которая ОТКРЫВАЕТ ДУШУ ДЛЯ ДЕМОНОВ мучителей, БЕСОВ ПОРОЧНЫХ СТРАСТЕЙ, слуг дьявола. Сам же ФИЛЬМ на самом деле прежде всего НАМЕРЕННО «РАЗЖИГАЕТ», но В ДУШАХ самих ЗРИТЕЛЕЙ, действие множества СТРАШНЫХ ПОРОЧНЫХ СТРАСТЕЙ(наши духовные болезни), например таких как, ЛУКАВСТВО(ЗЛОСТЬ), ГОРДЫНЯ, ТЩЕСЛАВИЕ(ПАГУБНАЯ СТРАСТЬ К ЛЮДСКОЙ СЛАВЕ), ЗАВИСТЬ, ЧЕЛОВЕКОУГОДИЕ, ГНЕВ, МЕСТЬ, НЕНАВИСТЬ, ПОХОТЬ, БЛУД, НЕМОЩЬ, СТРАХ. И ВОТ так, ОГРОМНОЕ БОЛЬШИНСТВО ЛЮДЕЙ(не понимают), и ВОЛЬНО ИЛИ НЕ ВОЛЬНО СОГРЕШАЮТ(не вольно значит что, грех только у себя в уме, под действием той или иной порочной страсти, является таким же грехом), И ДЬЯВОЛ «ВВОДИТ» В ДУШУ человека ДЕМОНОВ МУЧИТЕЛЕЙ разных ПОРОЧНЫХ СТРАСТЕЙ. Ну А «ОБЩЕНИЕ» человека в жизни С любым собственным ДЕМОНОМ, «ПРИВЕДЁТ» рано или поздно только к одному, или К ПСИХИЧЕСКОМУ РАССТРОЙСТВУ, или УБИЙСТВУ, или САМОУБИЙСТВУ. И к АДУ для ДУШИ после физической СМЕРТИ тела. И что ещё имеет смысл в этом фильме. Показано (и опять же в виде насмешки, потому что мало зрителей к сожалению понимает что реально происходит в фильме) что каждый человек находится под строгим дьявольским контролем. А что это значит. Дело вот в чём. Душа абсолютно каждого человека на земле, и даже не важно подписывал этот человек контракт с дьяволом или нет, подменена внутри него душой второго демона мучителя лукавства(мужчиной или женщиной, а есть ещё и основной, их тоже два, но оба мужского рода), находящихся в наших душах по нашим грехам в земной жизни. Вот этот демон мучитель полностью подчиняет себе волю и мысли самого человека. Поэтому каждый живой человек на земле должен осознавать что наши мысли на самом деле не наши, а этого демона. Ну а приведёт всё это рано или поздно любого человека обязательно к тем последствиям о которых записано выше. И вот как БЫЛО БЫ ХОРОШО, ЧТОБЫ КАЖДЫЙ зритель ПОНИМАЛ это. НО ЭТО всё очень «глубокие» моменты, ПОНЯТЬ которые МОЖНО будет ТОЛЬКО ЧИТАЯ, И ГЛАВНОЕ, ИЗУЧАЯ КНИГУ ЖИЗНИ, СВЯТОЕ ЕВАНГЕЛИЕ.<br><br>А ПОЧЕМУ мы ВСЕ БОЛЬНЫ. После ГРЕХОПАДЕНИЯ АДАМА и ЕВЫ они были ИЗГНАНЫ ИЗ РАЯ. ДО грехопадения они ЖИЛИ В РАЮ подобно АНГЕЛАМ. После, БОГ одел их в «одежды» что значит в тела, и ДАЛ ЗАПОВЕДЬ «ПЛОДИТЕСЬ и РАЗМНОЖАЙТЕСЬ» и заселяйте Землю. НО для размножения, В ПОЛОВЫЕ ОТНОШЕНИЯ ПРИХОДИЛОСЬ ВСТУПАТЬ БРАТУ С СЕСТРОЙ. И ЭТО было вызвано необходимостью а НЕ ПОХОТЬЮ. И ВОТ ПОЧЕМУ КАЖДЫЙ рождающийся ребёнок уже ГРЕШЕН.  Только не физическое(физическое если вызвано похотью, между родными братьями и сёстрами), а так называемое ПЕРВОРОДНОЕ (ДУХОВНОЕ , ПРИЧИНА которого ГРЕХОПАДЕНИЕ) ПОВРЕЖДЕНИЕ(ГРЕХ, ПОРОЧНАЯ СТРАСТЬ) НА КАЖДОМ человеке при рождении. И У КАЖДОГО человека своя СОБСТВЕННАЯ СТРАСТЬ. И ЭТО БОЛЕЗНЬ, но БОЛЕЗНЬ прежде всего ДУХОВНОГО ПЛАНА.  И именно ПОРОЧНЫЕ СТРАСТИ людей являются ПРИЧИНОЙ ВСЕХ БЕД, СТРАДАНИЙ, и РАЗРУШИТЕЛЬНЫХ ДЕЙСТВИЙ на Земле. А вот условия ОСВОБОЖДЕНИЯ ОТ этого ПЕРВОРОДНОГО ГРЕХА(ПОВРЕЖДЕНИЯ, СТРАСТИ) как раз и ЗАПИСАНЫ в КНИГЕ ЖИЗНИ, СВЯТОМ ЕВАНГЕЛИЕ. НО СНАЧАЛА , чтобы донести их людям,  сам СЫН, БОГ СЛОВО ВОЧЕЛОВЕЧИЛСЯ(ИИСУС ХРИСТОС, имя ИИСУС означает СПАСИТЕЛЬ). А ЕГО за это РАСПЯЛИ. Но ОСТАЛОСЬ СВЯТОЕ ЕВАНГЕЛИЕ. Вот ЭТО и есть БОЖЕСТВЕННЫЕ УСЛОВИЯ , во первых ИЗБАВЛЕНИЯ ОТ ПЕРВОРОДНОГО ГРЕХА(а правильней сказать от ПОВРЕЖДЕНИЯ), И во вторых ДЛЯ СПАСЕНИЯ ДУШИ человеческой, ПОЛУЧЕНИЯ ЖИЗНИ ВЕЧНОЙ для ДУШИ, ПОСЛЕ физической СМЕРТИ тела , В ЦАРСТВИЕ НЕБЕСНОМ.<br><br>И поэтому ИСТИННАЯ ВЕРА В БОГА, в первую очередь ЗАКЛЮЧАЕТСЯ В «БОРЬБЕ» каждого ЧЕЛОВЕКА, ПРИ ЗЕМНОЙ ЖИЗНИ, СО своими собственными ПОРОЧНЫМИ СТРАСТЯМИ, И только ТАК можно получить СПАСЕНИЕ для своей ДУШИ.<br><br>Ну И ЕСЛИ каждый человек захочет &quot;БОРОТЬСЯ&quot; СО своими ПОРОЧНЫМИ СТРАСТЯМИ, ТО для начала, НУЖНО ПОВЕРИТЬ В БОГА, ПРЕСВЯТУЮ ТРОИЦУ: ОТЦА(СОЗДАТЕЛЯ ВСЕГО ЖИВОГО И НЕ ЖИВОГО, ВИДИМОГО мира и НЕВИДИМОГО),через СЫНА БОГА СЛОВО(ИИСУСА ХРИСТА), СВЯТОГО ДУХА. <br><br>А ЧТОБЫ  &quot;ПРИЙТИ&quot; к БОГУ или ПОЗНАТЬ БОГА необходимо ПОКАЯНИЕ.  <br><br>Ну А для того ЧТОБЫ ПОНЯТЬ ВСЁ что ЗАПИСАНО выше, И для ИСКРЕННЕГО ХРИСТИАНСКОГО ПОКАЯНИЯ, которое необходимо УСПЕТЬ(потому что ВРЕМЕНИ у каждого человека его земной жизни осталось ОЧЕНЬ МАЛО, придёт СМЕРТЬ, И ВСЁ )СДЕЛАТЬ ПРИ ЗЕМНОЙ ЖИЗНИ ЧЕЛОВЕКА, ПЕРВЫМ &quot;шагом&quot; БУДЕТ (и как об этом уже упоминалось выше) ЧТЕНИЕ и ГЛАВНОЕ, ИЗУЧЕНИЕ КНИГИ ЖИЗНИ, СВЯЩЕННОГО ПИСАНИЯ НОВЫЙ ЗАВЕТ. ✋🏻"

And horrifying to think that in today&#39;s digital age, a Hollywood production like this might be the basis of someone&#39;s belief. (or likely, lack thereof) I liked the premise, actually, and feel like it could have been a great movie, but unfortunately, the writer was abysmally naive about LDS church history, beliefs and practices. Additionally, the &quot;rational&quot; attack on faith was severely lacking and the examples presented were reminiscent of a Reddit discussion board.  It&#39;s sad that nobody reads good old-fashioned books anymore.<br><br>To be clear...Judaism is not/was not &quot;the precursor to Christianity.&quot;  And there is no such thing as &quot;Judeo-Christian.&quot;  They are apples and oranges.  There is the faith of the Israelites and Christ was a Jew.  But the Pharisees, Sadducees and Scribes, stood in diametric opposition to Christ. They rejected Him and crucified Him, precisely because He challenged their man-made traditions (Mishnah, or Oral Torah) which had radically contaminated God&#39;s law, substituting it with the laws and opinions of men.<br><br>One thing I did love about the movie was Grant&#39;s statement that today&#39;s religions are: ...&quot;as hollow and capitalistic as these games. &quot; (referring to the board game of Monopoly)  That statement goes hard and makes me think of Nietzsche&#39;s clever statement.  &quot;Show me the redemption in your own life, that I may be inclined to believe in your Redeemer.&quot;"

It presents some absurd questions when they enter the house, as they try to teach him about religion, but he claims that religions are baseless and mere fairy tales. Just sit down with any Islamic scholar, and they will show you stars in broad daylight. 😂 Forget about Islamic scholars—ask those questions to me, and I’ll show you stars in broad daylight. This movie clearly reflects an atheistic viewpoint."

Few people will probably ever watch such daring &amp; risky film, let alone to deeply understand the messages of the film. I truly admire the filmmaker for being courageous enough to make a bold, non cookie-cutter movie like this! Finally, a high-quality movie that can be discussed deeply &amp; makes people think."

The weather and their discomfort probably played into their erroneous decision. Keeping safe via the presence of a female stranger is not a strategy. Have they not heard of Hamolka? People use other people to get what they want. <br>I&#39;ve heard men ask a number of times why I was not afraid, and every time it creeped me out. Only an oddball even starts to think that way, and they&#39;re thinking that way for a reason. I was fine, but they knew who their people were. It was when I was in Israel. Pay attention to that. It&#39;s not normal. When was the last time you asked a small child why they&#39;re not afraid of you? That&#39;s not going to end well. I realize he said don&#39;t be afraid, and that&#39;s worse, unless you&#39;re in a legitimate scary course that you signed up for and being instructed to do something preplanned and rational with a 99.9% probability of success, like rappelling. <br>Without giving it away you&#39;ll see an addictive personality emerge, in for a penny, in for a pound. If you&#39;re unsure and downright creeped out right now, do you honestly think things will miraculously improve as...? <br>The thing is, people will see the door being physically locked and the girls&#39; search for a large enough window as the intrusion, but it&#39;s also the diatribe which should be found disturbing and invasive, and people often ignore the ick factor. You will meet this in evil geniuses whose aim is to disturb your mind. Those people are dangerous."

It had several codas inside the one plot to reignite our interest, with a few well-placed ideas inserted within. But on that note, the audience will recognize another movie having that same setup. I won&#39;t give away which one. Very nicely done."

@cara7356,2024-11-16T03:28:04Z,2024-11-16T03:28:04Z,1,"The ending is deliberately ambiguous, leaving room for different interpretations. The two main characters, Sister Paxton and Sister Barnes, are held captive by a sinister scholar, Mr. Reed, who challenges their faith and manipulates them with theological puzzles. As the story unfolds, the women try to escape and even confront Mr. Reed&#39;s cruel beliefs.<br><br>At one point, after Reed kills Sister Barnes, Paxton defies his attempts to convince her that they&#39;re trapped in a &quot;simulation.&quot; Ultimately, Paxton manages to stab Reed, but he&#39;s not easily defeated. In the film&#39;s final moments, just as Paxton seems to succumb to her fate, Sister Barnes mysteriously reappears and kills Reed, allowing Paxton to escape. However, the film closes with a haunting detail—a butterfly fluttering—suggesting that the entire sequence might have been a dream or part of a greater existential question about reality​."

Mr. Reed&#39;s &quot;elaborate system&quot; under his house, consists of practically nothing other than a small basement. Not only that, but it takes around half of the movie for the two Mormons to go down there, so the actual story can kick in. And even when the story does kick in, it&#39;s pretty shallow. <br><br>This is a prime example of a movie that (considering it only takes place in mostly three rooms) was clearly held back by low-budget. If the folk behind this film would have been given a larger budget, I believe they could have done far more to create a good, quality film. Instead, the directors&#39; big ideas for Heretic had to be scaled down a thousand times because of financial purposes. A version of this film where their creative freedom wasn&#39;t forced to become drastically limited, is one I&#39;d love to see."

@E.Harris-3,2024-11-10T18:54:42Z,2024-11-10T18:54:42Z,2,"BRAVO to this!  This was amazing.  A24 rarely disappoints.  They are redefining the horror genre with films that make you think.  There is a time and a place for ax wielding maniacs, and then there is intellectual horror.  These A24 films are never as literal as their trailers.  This movie keeps you guessing and was very suspenseful. The first half is a little slow because you’re expecting it to be paced differently due to horror generally moves faster…BUT they are setting up the story and every detail and every piece of dialogue matters later.  This gets in your head and in a good way.  It challenges people to THINK.   The two lead actresses were amazing and I&#39;ve never cared for Hugh Grant movies, but he is deliciously evil in this.  Very well written and highly recommended."
@ragragrec1,2024-11-10T18:39:04Z,2024-11-10T18:39:04Z,1,Such a well  made trailer - creepy enough but difficult to pin down the sub genre of horror!

This is just Hollywood playing off of stereotypes about the church. Nothing wrong with making a movie, just wanted to point out the misrepresentation. Our missionaries volunteer to serve their missions and through their service and sacrifice in the name of the Lord, God will always be with them to protect and help them in times of need."

@hannibalthe1st565,2024-11-08T18:56:16Z,2024-11-08T18:58:33Z,30,"The main thing i learned street contacting and knocking doors in Arizona from April 2011 to April 2013 was to always act happy and even excited to see strangers, use your eyes and body language in the most personable way possible and many people will be willing to talk to you, even if for only a minute. And get people to talk about their own relationship with Christ and try to relate. Its important to be as sincere and relatable as possible as an LDS missionary, and take no for an answer and feel the vibes people give you. I did a ton of service on my mission too, like picking weeds especially, and many people ended up appreciating us instead of avoiding us."
@hannibalthe1st565,2024-11-08T18:49:57Z,2024-11-08T18:52:49Z,0,I&#39;m a former lds missionary. Back in the day I served 2011 to 2013 female missionaries had to wear darker colors but now they can wear bright colors and even pants. They were allowed to wear brighter colors at the very end of my mission in early 2013. This trailer sort of conveys how the more socially awkward mssionaries would come across. Id usually tell them &quot;we&#39;re representatives of Jesus Christ&quot; and try to start any conversation I could in a casual manner. I dare say I hated the initial street contacting as it was painful for me as a young man to get that kind of rejection.

And Hugh Grant seems tailor made for almost any role he tackles, including this one. That being said, as a life-long active member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and a returned missionary, I have some issues with the protagonists being sister missionaries from the LDS faith. Almost everyone knows our missionaries go door to door as they try to share faith in Jesus Christ, but there are guidelines in place to prevent things exactly like this story from happening in real life…that’s my brief soapbox."

It could be a bad film, but knowing Hugh Grant is now taking on some deep seated psychological roles in films, from some of his other roles in the early 2000&#39;s and his funny roles in 2010&#39;s, he&#39;s going to do his hardest to carry this film.<br><br>I already want to watch it because I like A24 as a media company, I like the premise of faith, and I expect there will be an amazing finale!<br><br>I&#39;ll just watch it because of the psychology involved. That&#39;s something that is severely lacking today. Used to be you could just watch Disney&#39;s Pinocchio and wonder what a &quot;conscience&quot; was, what &quot;real&quot; was. Now, it&#39;s much more complicated. The brain is so complex, and I think this movie will heavily focus on that aspect of thinking.<br><br>Also...non-United States Actors will always be seen as better actors, because they actually act their soul out. Our actors here in the USA, do put their heart into it (even their soul) but media companies will never be able to hire USA actors/actresses for less."

It looks like what they&#39;re saying is accurate to what missionaries would typically say. To anyone who is reading this, I do believe the church is true for the most part and high suggest inquiring about it unless you&#39;re LGBTQ. While they try to be kind to those outside of traditional families, they don&#39;t fully have a place for you within the church or after this life. They claim their stance is based on doctrine, but to me and many others it&#39;s a man made policy. There are a few man made policies, but other than those, the belief, values,  and community is wonderful."

It does matter to me because I was a missionary and I currently have a niece serving a mission in another country, and I have a daughter who, at 8 years old, always tells me that she wants to go on a mission with the characters of those actresses in this film. I appreciate this film because it puts the global spotlight on the risk that our young missionary girls could or could not run."

He&#39;ll be an academic, possibly a behavioural psychologist or maaaybe religion studies, who got drummed out of his university for his radical methods.  Perhaps obsessed with the psilocybin experiements that were done in the 60s at a seminary. Perhaps he was abused by the church as a kid, because A24 loves pushing buttons. I 100 percent believe psychedelics will be involved, perhaps a mix of mushrooms and datura. <br><br>I&#39;m putting this here so I can go back and look at it and see if I was right about anything. <br><br>I&#39;m 100 percent going to watch this movie."

I know others love them and it&#39;s a safe way to be scared in this life and they can be real thought provoking things too. So I just let people enjoy them, am glad they are there for others to enjoy and I just ignore them.<br>However,..<br>I am a Hugh Grant fan. I have thought for years he was criminally underrated by critics and typecast and pigeonholed by the industry. In recent years, freed from being a romantic lead cause Hollywood is horribly ageist, he&#39;s had a much more fun variety of roles. Usually comedic but definitely different. Paddington 2 anyone?<br>So I reckon I will break my long standing aversion to horror/chiller films of unpleasantness just to watch him be the bad guy in this.

@MikeMumbelz,2024-08-30T00:26:04Z,2024-08-30T00:26:04Z,264,"I watched this trailer a few times now and I feel like I might know what the story is about. I&#39;m just blind guessing but I feel like there are solid hints.<br><br>Hugh Grant is the follower of an esoteric and ancient religious practice. Likely, they&#39;ll mix it in with general occultism.<br><br><br>In ancient Greece, there was something called the Eleusinian Mysteries. While there&#39;s a lot behind them, the short and general of it is they were rituals where a person ingested a psychedelic substance called Kykeon. This is done before the person was then sent into a temple which was a kind of religious maze or labyrinth. It was set up in such a way that the themes and experiences inside the temple reflected the message of the ritual as a whole. You basically would go in, lose your mind on this psychedelic while traversing the ritual themed maze, then emerge as a completely reborn person.<br><br>Some described this ritual as being so powerful and so profound that initiates would lose their fear of death entirely because they genuinely believed they experienced God or the afterlife or something extremely divine in nature. <br><br>The Greek style statue that gets revealed when Hugh flips the switch at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9i2vmFhSSY&amp;t=78"">1:18</a> makes me think they&#39;re leaning in that direction. The fact the room he&#39;s standing in is filled with religious symbols from different faiths (There&#39;s a menorah and a Shiva statue on the bookshelves to his right and left at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9i2vmFhSSY&amp;t=83"">1:23</a>) - The implication being he studies religion and probably dives into the mystical topics behind each one. Occultism takes inspiration from a lot of religions so the mixture implies something in that direction.<br><br><br>Hugh modeled his house after this labyrinth style temple used during the Eleusinian Mysteries. The girls likely drank a tea or drink which was filled with the psychoactive substance (look at the table at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9i2vmFhSSY&amp;t=32"">0:32</a>) and he&#39;s about to send them on a journey that will change their lives. <br><br>&quot;It will make your hearts beat faster. It may even make you want to die.&quot;<br><br>He&#39;s describing the effect of the drink he gave them. The labyrinth he sends them into simply amplifies the fear and hallucinations which drives them further towards the end goal. That goal?<br><br>&quot;Do not be afraid. You will witness a miracle.&quot;<br><br>He is sending them into this maze to reenact an ancient ritual which forces a person to overcome their fears and gives them a genuine religious experience. He purposely nudges them through the door which leads into the maze by challenging their faith. As religious people, they&#39;ll accept the challenge (which is what Hugh wants) while the door which said &quot;disbelief&quot; likely led them outside. <br><br>He isn&#39;t torturing them for being religious. He knows that the only people who can be granted the right to experience the miracle are those who genuinely do believe. It&#39;s all part of the ritual."

(Even though I hate horror) from the trailer I like how they have represented the Sister Missionaries, and it genuinely feels pretty respectful. <br><br>They have outfits, hair, even the proselyting bags down. You can tell they put a ton of attention to detail to the creation of this movie. (Major props!!!!)<br><br>And from the trailer the missionaries seem to be made out as attentive and smart, such as not entering his home unless an adult female was present (unfortunately people lie) noticing the candle, and trying to get out of the situation. <br><br>-I had an experience on my mission where we were teaching a man who said his wife was inside, luckily she was, she was an older woman that only spoke Lebanese and was in very poor health, so she had a hard time moving and did not meet us at the door. We had no reason to believe he was lying, and he wasn’t, I can’t even IMAGINE what these Sisters would have been thinking, knowing they unknowingly put themselves in such a terrible situation. <br><br>But as a recently returned missionary I don’t know if I will be able to watch this movie as soon as it comes out. It is way too real. Missionaries see a lot of terrible things, and unfortunately many are put in danger, but luckily the church has implemented so many great trainings, resources, and procedures to do everything they can to insure the safety of their Missionaries and other members. <br><br>My love goes out to all the families that lost loved ones as they were out serving the Lord. May they rest in peace 🤍<br><br>These Sisters Missionaries are young girls, average aged 19-28,  often living in foreign places, speaking a different language, companions with someone they just met, meeting with dozens of strangers a week, hoping that situations like this will only happen in movies. <br><br>While it is very interesting to see this representation it might take me a while to actually WATCH it, I currently have way too many loved ones and friends out on missions 😂"

In facing the possibly deceptive and false nature of a cue, the belief in nebulous faith becomes as fickle and illussory as a pie scented flame. My guess is dark haired girl chooses the &#39;Disbelief&#39; door, since she is wired to scrutinize cues and doubt an object of belief."

It&#39;s interesting that some low-budget horror films/psycho-thrillers with a very small cast like this one are garnering momentum among audience and critics alike. I just recently read about the Irish horror film/supernatural thriller Oddity that had a limited release in the US but received rave reviews from critics and audience alike and may develop a cult following. I very much hope that some of these productions - also like Heretic, which also sounds very promising - become sleeper hits and manage to convince the industry that exciting stories about people are the way to go, rather than CGI overkill based on well-known IPs..."
