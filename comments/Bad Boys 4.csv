A Cheap, and cheesy film with terrible lines and bad acting. <br><br>The first and second movies were nice, third was ok, and this installment just made me sad and disappointed. <br>Some of the action sciences were ok, could have been better. Most likely made for Asian markets with the intention of high ticket sales."

Uncontained and all over the place, BB4 was all over the place but controlled and contained. Reggie, Aretas, Kelly and Dom could all definitely do a spin off together, make Mike and Marcus Captains. Don&#39;t take too long with it too."

They are the best cop combo . <br>Well I just enjoy these two actors separately or together. <br>(Dont enjoy Will smith wife displaying all their family issues dont think its healthy for them most definitely not healthy for the public hope she stops sabotaging his career). <br>Miss Will movies hope this is sign all negative blown over &amp; that  both these actors making come back . Its nice to enjoy their chemistry again including the appearance of the Captain . Overall enjoyable movie so far.

@SoCoolScience,2024-06-12T19:54:13Z,2024-06-12T19:54:13Z,1,"Action spot on, story jonny b goode but the comedy falls flat. I definitely enjoyed the story and all the action that it brings with it, but if your looking for hard laughs there not here. A few good chuckles here and there from Grandpa Lawrence. His antics play well off of Smith&#39;s slap job. Over all, it take a while to get started, alot of extra scenes that are not needed for the story, slows down in the middle but has a thrilling satisfactory finish. Im going B+ on this one."

Hope his entire salary was tied to the movie breaking even because good chance this flick goes straight into the toilet.  I just can&#39;t get out of my head Will laughing at Chris Rock&#39;s joke until his handler (are they married?  not married? does he stand in line behind all the other guys hoping for some affection from his wife? etc.)  before he did the famous slap?  If I can watch for free, I still wouldn&#39;t watch it.  Damn, hope Martin Lawrence isn&#39;t collateral damage.  Diddy will take his entire entourage to see for sure -- he loves bit*h slapping people and kicking them while they are down... get some real role models people!"

The only reason these &quot;stars&quot; keep getting put in these movies is because they sold their soul to the machine and now, for all the terrible things they have done to others and the things they allowed to happen to themselves, the machine owes them these roles. Do not buy tickets to this movie, do whatever you have to see it free if you have to see it. Why else wouldn&#39;t you start putting in good actors who are fresh and inexpensive compared to these already obscenely rich scumbags?"

They won&#39;t stop until they f...k up all the good stories and depict every man, black or white, as miserable thugs who need women and LGBTQRSTUVWXYZ to rescue them.

While they are keep Mike young and fresh (no pun intended). Which for me  at least makes Mike kind of pathetic. Both Smith and Lawrence are pushing 60 years old, but the movie keeps acting like Mike is still a young man. How you gonna be a seasoned cop but at the same time a rookie that has a lot to learn."

Theresa Burnett has been replaced by another actress who is Tasha Smith who is replacing Theresa Randle as Theresa Burnett in the fourth series of Bad Boys!

@javarjv,2024-04-01T16:19:58Z,2024-04-01T16:19:58Z,1,"Man, i use to be a big fan of wills, but now i just really hate the fact he did what he did when &amp; where he did it, because if it wasn&#39;t during such a big event, it probably wouldn&#39;t have been recorded, or if it was, it probably wouldn&#39;t have been picked up by the news like it was, an we could have just pretended it never happened, or just legit forgot all about it,<br>but because it happened the way it happened, unfortunately for me it truly ruined will smith ever being in anything, cause all i can picture is him sim*ing c*cking for his cheating narcissistic man acting wife, <br>all i can think of is them talking about entanglements, how will smith is creepaly similar to adam 22 from no jumper, how everytime he speaks in a movie, especially when he is talking s**t to say a criminal, i just imagine he is gonna start yelling about keeping his f**king wife&#39;s name, out thier f**king month&#39;s!!!! <br><br>An that if very unfortunate for me, because as awesome as Martin Laurence is, as much as i liked the older bad boy films, as much as i liked a lot of other movie&#39;s will himself has been in, like- independence day &amp; i am legend, (witch i wish we had got a sequel for a long time ago), <br>I just can&#39;t watch anymore film&#39;s he is in, i can&#39;t support it."

Men In Black and Independence Day are great to watch but after the slap it&#39;s all just gone. He literally assaulted someone in front of the world&#39;s media and got a standing ovation by the rest of the phonies. He sat there clapping like a seal when he was too stupid to realise that Anthony Hopkins was insulting him, not praising him. It was all a nice guy act that I fell for. I&#39;m sure this comment will get deleted by Sony."

Still making him integral and what drives the plot plus bringing him back a&#39;la Randy in Scream is a nice touch. <br><br>And it seems time+context is important in accepting actors and their major flaws.

@mikebrown5561,2024-03-28T22:40:57Z,2024-03-28T22:40:57Z,0,Is Will the Woke dude that slapped a much smaller guy because he made a joke about his Controlling Wife Jada? Let&#39;s see Will Smith put his hands on someone bigger than himself. Let&#39;s see him slap Dwayne Johnson or Mike Tyson. The same Mike Tyson that is going to show that age is only a number when he KO&#39;s Jake Paul in the first round. Mike might not be as tall as Will or Jake Paul but he has a long career knocking those big dudes out. Dudes bigger than both Will Smith and Jake Paul.

I was fully prepared to come on here and just blast the s*** out of this. and I knew I had to watch the trailer before I did that for posterity. but son of a b*<b>**. I don&#39;t know why I don&#39;t know how but for some god forsaken reason. This actually looks good. It actually looks better than the third one. It actually... kind of sort of maybe recapture some of that original magic that I feel was somewhat lacking in the third. It&#39;s just a trailer and trailers can be misleading. So at the very least I&#39;ll say... This is a f*****</b> awesome trailer.

Jada was probably being toxic as usual and the was a stick up and she was nagging him to take care of it.

@brians9169,2024-03-26T21:28:38Z,2024-03-27T07:58:02Z,2,Ordinarily I would be anxious to see this movie but since Will Smith can not conduct himself in front of an audience and on live television without slapping someone and only being banned for 10 years. I rather pass and hope this movie fails at the box office bigtime.

I wont be watching because I will never think the oscars slap is something ill ever forget and its spoilt all the films i used to love. It not only represented black people in a bad way, but i just cannot see films with Will in ever again. That always springs to mind now if i see him, and its ruined his career as far as im concern. Yeah, he will still have his fans, but they overlook what happened. No time passing by will make me reason with this actor no matter what he does."

@Pocketkid2,2024-03-26T18:49:17Z,2024-03-26T18:49:17Z,0,Man I miss the days when movie trailers were something other than a three minute retelling of the entire film. I enjoyed the first two by Michael Bay but was very underwhelmed by the third film that was not directed by him. I&#39;ll probably go see this one if it gets good reviews.

They just brought it back to kinda touch on the nostalgic aspect hoping those of us that loved the first 2 would all flock to see the 3rd 2 decades later. Didn&#39;t matter if the script and acting was crap. Hopefully they put more into this one but I&#39;m not holding my breath. Trailer looks good...but don&#39;t they all...

Even when Mike and Marcus are on the run the 4 of them are nowhere to be seen. Maybe they are all killed off early to build up the new villain as a genuine threat.

And I don&#39;t care if anyone disagrees with my opinion. But this is one of the few franchises where each movie is better than the last. So I got high hopes for this one.

@CaptainReynolds-flyinspace,2024-03-26T15:22:38Z,2024-03-26T15:22:38Z,0,Old Boys: helpless ride. Main problem is self-copying. Half of the trailer is just reminders of why many peoples liked first two movies. Dont tell me even through jokes that main characters are old now. Dont show me remakes of scenes from first movies. Show me how characters was formed by their past and world changes. Show what happened with them today. Kill nostalgia. If nostalgia is driver of you new movie about present times - you have big problem.

Sony or the production companies, if you’re reading this, and you want to make an universe, we need a spin-off with Mike’s son, Armando. The actor who portrayed him was phenomenal! If you like my idea, make is a back door spin-off, don’t market is as one. Let the audience figure it out when we buy the ticket and we’re either at the end or halfway through the movie! Given you can’t market it as one, we need big names to join the film, but not the usual suspects. If you’re thinking “the Rock,” let’s make him the bad guy since he’s always good. You’re welcome!"

@ItsPlayWryte,2024-03-26T13:43:33Z,2024-03-26T13:43:33Z,2,I hope Will gets his career on track after this. Hes one of the greatest actors of all time. He was regarded as this nice and humble down to earth celebrity for decades and he made an unprofessional move on live tv that didnt fit the character we all knew him as but he slapped someone. He didnt kill or harm anyone in a way that a criminal would have. Trying to cancel him was so dumb.
