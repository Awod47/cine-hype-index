@akon2.2,2025-01-31T20:22:19Z,2025-01-31T20:22:19Z,2,"actually really enjoyed the film, Todd Phillips knew that the film wasn&#39;t going to be enjoyed by everyone because of its nature and it swaying away from the first film, even hinting at it when Joaquin Phoenix says that &quot;they&#39;re not giving the people what they want&quot;, imo the directing and acting in this film is amazing, the overall story has its issues but in my opinion this film is still worth the watch!"

@5_to_Life,2025-01-28T03:16:27Z,2025-01-28T03:16:27Z,2,"As expected, Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga did an excellent job. The movies storyline was great and it made me interested in what happens next the whole time. The depth of the characters were deep and relatable. Going into the pain of the Jokers childhood and the abuse he endured by his mother. It makes you want to take the Joker side. <br>The only thing FOR ME, is that I don’t like musicals much. But it was very entertaining. And I personally wish the ending would’ve have been more …’favorable’ for the Joker. But that’s my 2 cents. I’d definitely recommend Warner Brothers version of THE JOKER."

@nicolewalsh7959,2025-01-16T21:48:40Z,2025-01-16T22:01:26Z,4,"What a terrible terrible adaptation of the Joker. It makes the first one look ridiculous and a joke literally compared to this odd musical sequel. The first one opened up what mental illness really is and I don’t understand why some people claiming it’s too dark too dark;  yet there has been many movies they made called the purge?!?  I suppose that’s popular so it’s ok. I think it would’ve been better if it was a drama and if Jennifer Lawrence was Harley Quinn. And the character, Harley Quinn, who worked at the hospital. Sorry, but those two had no chemistry and they just look like homeless crackheads together."

Lady Gaga was great as Harley (despite the hate she gets for this role). Film was just not centered on them but a homage to Ledger&#39;s joker, as you see in the end. Unnecesary movie? Perhaps... but it&#39;s point is to give closure to Arthur Fleck... a pathetic closure, like his life 🥀"

@きゃんさー-m2g,2024-12-26T07:17:53Z,2024-12-26T07:17:53Z,0,Arthur’s greatest flaw is his lack of empathy for others. What about the lives of those killed by the Joker? What about their families or the feelings of their bereaved loved ones? Arthur only focuses on his own position and doesn’t consider the emotions of others. That’s why no one truly understands Arthur’s heart. His pettiness is reflected in others. The hearts of others are mirrors that reflect oneself.

I usually don’t like musicals but this movie was just perfection. The singing was just casual it was a nice touch and I loved the songs. Joaquin is amazing! He played the best Joker in my opinion. And I love lady Gaga as Harley Quinn she did great!"

Two highly insane people that are completely out of touch with reality. Unfortunately, Joaquin wasn&#39;t that great of a singer. <br><br>I hated the ending. So he wasn&#39;t the real joker, but the guy who stabbed him multiple times was? A guy who was a back character and only had 2 or 3 lines of dialogue? But I thought the previous film and this one was supposed to be about JOKER&#39;S ORIGIN STORY! So now I&#39;m super confused and wonder why they made the films in the first place if he wasn&#39;t the actual Joker."

This movie was an “Art Piece” style of film.  It wasn’t meant to be a typical film with gun toting bad guys……… this was interpretation with music, and it was AMAZING! Incredible! Everything I expected.  Deep and dark with 100 nuances typical theater goers don’t get. <br>So glad to see the Joker and Harley portrayed this way.  Excellent job."

It should have been a Broadway play &#39; Joker the Musical&#39;.  If you took all references to Marvel names and characters out. This script could be used for any movie about a Psychopath and his girlfriend.

Reflecting on the world today and reading the hate this movie and Arthur receive in the comments (and within the movie itself) touches something deeper. Arthur needed help, but society failed him. Instead, they used him as a vehicle to channel their own fear, not realizing how this destroys the most helpless, Arthur, among us.<br><br>When the reporter says, “A monster,” it breaks my heart.

Definitely not getting my vote for SAG awards, I want my money back from the movie rental.  I have never seen a superhero movie with a myriad of showtunes. Skip this movie it had such potential but it was ruined with showtunes."

@leamorenalucero,2024-11-14T16:13:55Z,2024-11-14T16:14:38Z,2,"I love every Ounce of this Film. It has so many Layers that many cannot see it directly or need to catch up. The Music was added to make the Relationship between Arthur Fleck and Lee Quinzel romantic. She loved the Joker and not the real Person which is Arthur Fleck. This makes a lot of Sense too (a different Approach of the Relationship with Joker and Harley) that Lee later on finds the &quot;other&quot; Joker and sticks to an Idea of Him. The Plottwist in the End is fantastic. This Film is another great way to reflect on Humanity. What started out as an untreated Disease (or many false Information in the History) led to a false Inspiration / led to a Misinterpretation in the Present. <br><br>As mentioned, many Audience couldn&#39;t see it right away because there are so many Informations at once in this Film. The Music was wonderful sarcastic approach to over all how Humanity copes up or covers a lot through Music. Because sets the Mood of the Emotion and through that we tend to forget or neglect the Objective part of Life. &quot;That is Entertainment&quot; or better said Distraction!<br><br>Again, what a fantastic Move.

What&#39;s really amusing about this movie is that it doesn&#39;t take long for its weaknesses to somehow become strengths, and that&#39;s all part of the charm. It&#39;s familiar (The Karate Kid, E.T.), it&#39;s bizarre (was that a school dance or a disco scene?) and I get a smile from seeing Canada as small-town America. But this is the kind of underdog story you can&#39;t help but like, and that&#39;s not even covering the movie&#39;s greatest weapon: the music. Farnham&#39;s &quot;Thunder In Your Heart&quot; is every bit the &#39;80s time capsule that is &quot;Rad&quot;."

The line that QT said to get my attention was &quot;it feels like it was made by the joker&quot; idk im officially stoked.

I wanted to give it a chance especially since I didn’t get to see it in theaters because I was too busy with a work project while it was in theaters.  All I can say is I am glad I didn’t spend the money to see it while it was out.  The whole time my only reasoning to continue to watch was simply because I kept waiting for it to get better.  It wasn’t even a movie, it was a musical.  Like watching gLee, prison edition.  Except if it were gLee, it probably would probably have been better.  Even renting the movie was a waste of money.  The only good part being at the end when they reveal who is the real Joker.  The one who continues the Joker persona.  The late Heath Ledger version.  Other than that, the rest for sure wasn’t worth seeing."

@HoseinNajafi-h2c,2024-11-03T09:27:20Z,2024-11-03T09:27:20Z,1,سال ۲۰۱۹ نمایش فیلم «جوکر» شور و هیجانی بین جوانان آمریکایی راه انداخت که ارتباطی به کیفیت فیلم نداشت.یعنی خیلی ها بدون اینکه فیلم را ببینند وارد فاز جوکر شده بودن و مانند او گریم کرده به خیابانها می آمدند.در اغلب آثار ساخته شده بر اساس قصه‌ی جوکر که مستقیما از کامیک بوک‌ها الهام گرفته‌اند، جوکر شخصیت شروری است که گذشته‌ای مبهم دارد و کسی نمی‌داند که واقعا از کجا آمده است.ولی جوکر فیلیپس اینگونه نبود و برای جوکر یک شخصیت حقیقی صفر تا صد با گذشته ای روشن ساخت که جالب بود.در چنین شرایطی ممکن مخاطب اهل جهان کامیک بوک‌ها و دوستدار شخصیت جوکر که برای دیدن فیلمی از شخصیت محبوبش محصول کمپانی دی سی بلیط خریده، احساس سرخوردگی کند و تصور کند که سازندگان این فیلم تازه سرش کلاه گذاشته‌اند و اثری ساخته‌اند که فقط نام و شمایل جوکر را به عاریت گرفته و هیچ چیز دیگرش به آن شرور نمی‌ماند.یعنی جوکر فیلیپس هیچ شباهتی به جوکر دنیای بتمن نداشت و یک شخصیت دیگری بود که افسردگی داشت.پس این ایراد به اثر تاد فیلیپس وارد نیست؛ چرا که او در فیلم دوم فقط از نام شخصیت‌های مطرح موجود در جهان کامیک بوک‌های دی سی استفاده کرده و کاری به چگونگی حضور آن‌ها در فیلم‌های پیش از خود و البته کامیک بوک‌ها ندارد؛ نه هارلی کوئینش آن هارلی کوئین آشنا است و بیشتر عاشق دلخسته‌ای است که شیفته‌ی جوکر شده و نه هاروی دنت در مقام دادستان شهر همان هاروی دنت موجود در دیگر آثار است و نه خود شخص شخیص جوکر.در فیلم جوکر جنون مشترک فقط نام و گریم جوکر وجود دارد و هیچ شباهتی به دنیای کمیک بوک جوکر وجود ندارد.یک فیلم عاشقی دادگاهی که انتهایش تلخ تمام می‌شود وسلام.مهم‌ترین ایرادش استراتژی سازندگان در استفاده از کلیشه‌های سینمای موزیکال است.واقعا خنده دار نیست جوکر موزیکال؟به نظرم با این فیلم ابهت جوکر کلا از بین رفت.در چنین قابی است که تمام آن سکانس‌های پر تاکید بر فضای بیرون از دادگاه و بیرون از زندان که مملو از احساس همراهی با جوکر است، اهمیت خود را از دست می‌دهند و فقط بهانه‌ای جلوه می‌کنند تا فیلم‌ساز از عشقی آتشین بگوید.انگار فیلمساز ما یادش رفته در خال ساخت فیلم جوکر است نه یک عاشقانه موزیکال؟<br>پس نفس اقتباس از یک شخصیت و تبدیل کردنش به چیزی دیگر نه تنها ایرادی ندارد، بلکه می‌تواند نقطه قوت فیلم هم باشد اما وقتی آن شخصیت کسی چون جوکر است که شهری را به هم ریخته و پیروان بسیاری دارد و خود فیلم‌ساز هم مدام در این جا و آن جا آن را بازگو می‌کند و به این می‌نازد که در حال بر هم زدن بازی است، پس باید به این شور و هیجان جاری در فضا همان اندازه توجه شود که به عشق آتشین او به یک زن یا دست کم گذرا برگزارش نکند تا مخاطب احساس کند در حال تماشای اثری عاشقانه است که بدون دلیل خاصی ضدقهرمانش مردی است که پیروان بسیاری در خارج از محیط زندان دارد و بر حسب تصادف لقبش جوکر است.فکر کمم به  کسی بگوییم این جوکر دشمن اصلی بتمن است به من و شما و بتمن باهم بخندد چون واقعا این فیلمی که ساخته شده اصلا شبیه قسمت اولش که چه عرض کنم حتی شبیه جوکر افتضاح جوخه انتحاری هم نبود.اما خواسته‌های فیلم‌ساز به همین جا ختم نمی‌شود؛ فیلم «جوکر: جنون مشترک» دوست دارد فیلمی آکنده از غم و اندوه باشد.حتی زمانی که جوکر کشته میشود با این‌که یک قاتل خون خوار است ولی طوری صحنه ساخته شده که بیننده برای او هم اشک می‌ریزد.اما رفته رفته این بده و بستان جذابیتش را از دست می‌دهد که ناشی از تصمیمات ناگهانی فیلم‌ساز در تغییر ناگهانی مسیر قصه است.وقتی پوستر فیلم را می‌بینیم انگار قرار است جوکر و معشوقه اش باهم به خونریزی بروند ولی ظاهرا آنها فقط دو بره عاشقند که هیچ کاری هم از دستشان برنمی آید مگر در تصوراتشان.در این مبارزه پیروزی نهایی با هارلی است.زیرا آزاد می‌شود کشته هم نمی‌شود معروف هم میشود انگار جوکر وسیله ای بوده برای پیشرفت او.

It feels like, because Lady Gaga&#39;s natural profession is singing, they have incorporated that into the movie and turned it into a musical. As much as I love Lady Gaga and her music, the singing spoiled our expectations of The Joker. Throughout the movie we found ourselves sighing at the tedious repetitive songs each time their mouths opened to sing. Personally, we never enjoyed it and was glad when it was over. However, if you like musicals, you might like it. Thumbs down from us though!"

We are shown what happened or is happening inside the mind of the joker. We are shown what his reality looks like and how twisted and beautiful it is at the same time. People who are broken or are healing through a difficult trauma can get this i think. A simple message is shown in this movie EVERYBODY NEEDS LOVE THAT PLAIN AND SIMPLE. If you analyze the movie it is actually beautiful even the lyrics. Just my opinion

@EveryBeardHasAStory,2024-11-01T22:53:00Z,2024-11-01T22:53:00Z,2,"The Joker dies at the end of this.<br><br>For those of you that don&#39;t know, a lot of wealthy people took great offence to Heath Ledger&#39;s Joker. Specifically the money burning scene. That&#39;s why they killed Heath. Yes, really. This Joaquin Phoenix iteration was meant to subdue the Joker. To make him powerless. Like the billions of people who are powerless in the real world. The first movie was a half and half experience to ease audiences into this absolute train wreck of sheer, and outright hatred towards humanity. Do not watch this if you are a fan of the Joker character. Do not watch this if you feel you&#39;ve been mistreated through life. Do not watch this if you are a DC fan. Do not watch this if you enjoyed the first movie. Plain and simple, do not watch this. This &quot;movie&quot; was nothing but a message from the wealthy to the poor that reads, and I quote: &quot;You will never be free.&quot; I pirated this garbage and I am not only feeling buyers remorse, but absolute disgust. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23deathtotherich"">#DeathToTheRich</a>"

Let me start with the positive aspects of this sequel. The whole atmosphere is the same as the first movie. Same lighting, same colors, same looks. The negative aspects: the accompanying  music is the same as the first movie, most of the lines are the same as the first, Joker suddenly can sing (why?), it&#39;s very awkward to hear him singing. The storyline was very vague, when was it fantasy? When real? The ending when Joker dies was very unexpected. So the guy who killed him became the Joker? Interesting. That explains his cut mouth. 5.3 at IMDb is even too much. I would rate it a 3."

@Ususksi,2024-10-25T00:08:52Z,2024-10-25T00:08:52Z,1,Joker 2: A Star Is Born<br>This movie shouldn&#39;t have been made the story didn&#39;t make sense it undo&#39;s the first movie. They should of made a Batman movie then at the end of it reveals Joaquin Phoenix&#39;s Joker then make a sequel. Why did they add the scene with Bruce in Joker if he isn&#39;t the real Joker and making it a musical was a bad move. And why did they do that to Arthur all the trauma he suffered to add more to it and kill him off makes you realize the intent of the writers he didn&#39;t deserve that kind of ending. They could of went in a different direction and made a franchise with him being the comic Joker we all know but instead they wanted a quick cash grab get Lady Gaga for marketing and make a bland sequel. The only good thing about this movie is the acting and visuals other than that don&#39;t bother watching it will ruin the first one. Do better Todd you knew it was bad.

It&#39;s poetic how the real fans treat him the exact same way the anarchists in the movie do."

@obsoletepowercorrupts,2024-10-18T22:30:27Z,2024-10-18T22:30:27Z,0,"I just watched the best two hour eighteen minute long cigarette advert. It&#39;s probably even better in the French version.<br>The sequel movie (Joker foie gras) was fine by me. It was more like Children Of Men <i>(Clive Owen)</i> mixed with Sweeney Todd <i>(the Johnny Depp musical)</i> than being like Natural Born Killers. It forces adults to stop taking kids toys by culturally appropriating action hero movies. Instead of snatching that candy from a baby, it lights an incendiary post-coital tobacco smoke. There&#39;s no getting smoked, without getting fired.<br>Now the World has been goosed, let&#39;s just hope that in the upcoming third instalment <i>&quot;Joker: Ménage à Foie&quot;</i> the implied baby-joker born from the fruitful loins of Harlequin is as good a gander. <br>In the law case which touched on the mentality, Joker could have kept mum about his predicted programming, and the third maybe just maybe could have him do that because an explosion at the court building is enough to force a retrial, especially since the jury had not finished saying what they had decided and also the car bomb could be argued legally as always having been an implicit event that might happen what with the publicity and crowds showing anger, which can sway and intimidate a jury.<br>Some people have said they are disappointed by the film, but it is probably because they do not see it as more like an art-film <i>(hence the grey-pill Children-Of-Men gutsy ending and the Sweeney-Todd songs like a macabre Tim Burton)</i> and instead they base it upon the first one. If you have not seen the Joker1 movie, the Joker2 movie has a chance at being considered something different to it. If there is a Joker3, we&#39;ll see.<br>My comment has no hate in it and I do no harm. I am not appalled or afraid, boasting or envying or complaining... Just saying. Psalms23: Giving thanks and praise to the Lord and peace and love. Also, I&#39;d say Matthew6."

@evrenkar9006,2024-10-16T19:49:16Z,2024-10-16T19:49:16Z,0,"Hello, first of all, i think a great unjustice is being done to the movie Joker Folie a deux, maybe it&#39;s because The Joker and Lee did not destroy, kill or oppress or persecute, etc. The thought that the movie is a musical may be another effective reason, too. Bad comments spread by word of mouth may also be a factor. Actually, the movie is amazing. The cast is very successful. Despite his role being short, Steve Cogan was dazzling with. Also Harry Lawtey was amazing, too. Brendan Gleeson was like a real prison employee, he was that successful. Lady Gaga is a shining 🌟 star. As to Joaquin Phoenix, he is one of the best artists in the world, what a performance, he&#39;s performed a miracle. The score of the movie is not important at all. The Joker episode in court, the part where he says &quot; Joker is me &quot; was absolutely amazing. But the movie is confusing, the question of whether Arthur Fleck is a murderer or not murderer prevents you from making a decision with conflicting dialogues. Make your choice, the choice is yours. By the way, Joker (clown makeup one) is very sweet unless he kills. Be a little optimist for the movie and critisize the real problem."

Once Arthur realized and confessed he couldn’t keep up anymore, people’s reactions changed 180°. <br>Many fans who watched the initial Joker expected the sequel to be something more dramatic and entertaining; so when they saw that Arthur was just Arthur, they acted just the same as the fans of Joker within the movie.<br><br>Everyone wants catharsis and hates to be shown the reality. Of course if Lee loved him as a whole it would’ve been beautiful but in real life, not all love stories have a happy ending. And in the end, you’re the only person who can accept yourself for who you are, unconditionally. <br><br>I think it’s one thing to not like a movie but another thing to scoff and comment on it with so much disrespect."

Arthur already had the fear that he may anger Lee if time comes, he&#39;ll decide not to give people what they want. <br><br>It was all intentional.

Some even hated it just because it&#39;s a &#39;Musical&#39;, even though it&#39;s not really a musical film, considering the format. Well, who am I to judge? Art is subjective. What matters most is that - IT HAS BEEN SAID AND DONE.  Whether you love or hate Joker 2, YOU GET WHAT YOU DESERVE."

And I’m not trying to be negative or not appreciate the actors because let’s face it, Joaquin Phoenix &amp; Lady Gaga’s’s/ Stephanie’s are truly phenomenal in their own right and the film was well done and they had good chemistry. It was just so dark, and there was no light at the end of the tunnel. It just kept pulling you down down down. So I’m sorry but I was really disappointed."

@andrewa.5499,2024-10-12T17:47:29Z,2024-10-12T17:47:29Z,0,I love the joker because it shows what the world can do to a man. He is a man that wants to punish the evil but he became the very evil he tries to punish.
@Katiekin2333,2024-10-12T17:46:59Z,2024-10-12T17:47:23Z,2,"Terrible movie. Who in their right mind thought making this movie a musical was a good idea and with an actor who can’t even really sing. Yes lady gaga can obviously sing but that doesn’t make it any better. Atrocious in every way. Brendan gleeson was probably the only good thing in the movie. The plot was stupid, the songs were stupid and Joaquin phoneix and lady gags had no chemistry whatsoever. Avoid at all costs"

@RobertoVargas-j7z,2024-10-11T02:34:18Z,2024-10-11T02:34:18Z,4,"Alright, I&#39;m about to be publicly executed but I&#39;m just gonna say it how it is. <br>This movie and the way everyone reacted to it was completely intentional and the universal hate it received proves its point.<br>This film is a deconstruction of the idealized image of The Joker fans have created from his portrayal in comic books and other media, including the first Joker movie as well. <br>This movie condemns those people who idolize and admire what can be objectively called a terrible, evil person. The Joker is an absolute monster. You shouldn&#39;t be looking up to him. You shouldn&#39;t want to see chaos and violence.<br>It&#39;s the same as with people unironicaly looking up to characters like Patrick Bateman. It&#39;s a delusional way of thinking and this movie serves as a very uncomfortable wake up call for them. <br>Fans feel as if this movie mocks and insults them. Well, yeah. Thats exactly it. The more you expected to see this villainous Joker you are familiar with, the more this movie was gonna hurt you.<br>After the first movie, people &quot;sympathized&quot; with Joker because, after being constantly put down by everyone else, he snaps and brings chaos and violence upon. People thought it was cathartic. Well, they missed the point.<br>Ever since the first movie, Arthur is depicted as a very mentally unhealthy individual who never got the help and attention he needed. The way he turns into the Joker isn&#39;t something to be happy about. It&#39;s extremely tragic. He is consumed by his own suffering and in a moment of despair he snaps. He unintentionally reaffirms the negative image society has about mentally unhealthy individuals. And although in the movie some mentally ill people find some kind of catharsis in this Joker persona, most of his followers are actually deranged criminals who just want an excuse to exercise violence without restraint.<br>It&#39;s the same with most of the audience. They viewed the conclusion of the first movie as something cool and exciting. As some kind of twisted power fantasy. Well, let me tell you, as someone who has struggled with mental illness and who has been neglected by family members and institutions his whole life, I found the end of the first movie extremely heartbreaking. Of course I want my struggle to be heard, but I don&#39;t want to turn into violence and depravity. Feeling represented in Arthur and turning into a Joker is the last thing most mentally unhealthy people want. Violence and destruction is not the answer. We just want help. Being part of the group of people actually discussed in this movie, I found the emotional, sad and depressing, portrayal of Arthur&#39;s character in the sequel way more compelling and relatable than any kind of &quot;amazing&quot; Joker violence fest.<br>In the sequel, Arthur himself becomes disgusted with his actions and with his Joker persona because he realizes just how much more damage he has caused. Arthur may have snapped and done awful things in the first movie, but he&#39;s not a psychopath who lacks empathy. On the contrary, hes extremely emotional and sentimental.<br>In the end, Arthur owns up to his  actions and is abandoned and forgotten by everyone else who just looked at him due to his Joker persona. I&#39;ve read about people deeming Arthur&#39;s inner struggle and insecurities as boring compared to the over-the-top Joker persona they wanted to see. Well, both Harley and everyone else in Gotham feel the exact same way. The fact the reaction of these characters is mirrored with the reaction of the audience itself is a brilliantly meta way for the message of the movie to be conveyed.<br>It&#39;s understandable why people felt disappointed because the last thing they wanted to see was a vulnerable, beaten down &quot;Joker&quot;. They were expecting to see him turn into the Prince of Crime they love. But ever since the first movie, it wasnt a story about the villainous mastermind comic book Joker. It was a depressing story about a sad individual who accidentally creates a bigger than life public image and how he ends up being consumed by it.<br>I agree with this feeling of betrayal due to most of the marketing for the movie being very  deceitful and how it essentially played with and made a &quot;Joke&quot; off of the fans. But I think it was a necessary evil. <br>Todd and Phoenix and GaGa were extremely bold to do something like this and it may have very well stained their careers and reputation, also having &quot;wasted&quot; 200+ mill dollars into what was essentially a very expensive social commentary. But at the end of the day, seeing how everyone thinks about this movie, it can be said that they actually succeeded at what they wanted to do. <br>They managed to provoke an overwhelming, universal emotional reaction (just as any work of art should do) into 99% percent of the audience. And it is truly spectacular.<br>You all feel like you were ridiculed by not getting what you wanted. You feel as if this movie condemned you for even daring to be a fan of the first movie. Well, I&#39;m afraid to tell you that it is, indeed, your fault. It is your fault for expecting a conventional comic book movie. It is your fault for  expecting a gratuitous spectacle of violence. It is your fault for wanting to see your beloved chaotic Joker. This movie is unapologetically raw and anger inducing. They wanted to go beyond the medium itself and into the real world perception of the movie. You were indeed played for a fool and, as I said before, it was completely intentional.<br>The fact something like this was even attempted at a bluckbuster, super hero movie flick level is insane. This kind of artistry is often found in this other very niche part of the film industry.<br>This is not even a &quot;comic book film adaptation&quot; at this point. It is an extremely meta, genre redefining, work of art which completely succeeded in doing what it intended to do. You just ended up being obliviously turned into the central piece of this social experiment. And it&#39;s truly amazing.<br>And to double down on it, the end of the film in which Arthur is killed by an actually deranged and psychotic criminal, allegedly being the &quot;real&quot; Joker, can be seen as the movie itself saying &quot;Here you go. This is the Joker you wanted, right?&quot;.<br>What this &quot;real&quot; Joker says is actually directed at the audience itself.<br>&quot;You got what you f###### deserved&quot;."

@joebob3875,2024-10-10T15:33:22Z,2024-10-10T15:33:22Z,1,"This has gotta be one of the biggest movie letdowns that I have ever witnessed, as a huge fan of the first joker which I have watched more than 10 times I am extremely disappointed in this film. First of all, this was not advertised as a musical and secondly nothing about this film screams musical, I don’t even know where they got this horrible idea from. Musicals are for little kids and light romantic feel good movies. This was supposed to be a dark crime ridden movie lead by a violent psychopath. In no way did turning this into a musical make any sense…. this has got to be one of the biggest flops if not the biggest that I have seen in years and possibly my entire life. DON’T WASTE YOUR TIME!!!"

@sushi998,2024-10-10T14:38:38Z,2024-10-10T14:43:44Z,2,"I liked it. I believe most people just can&#39;t see through the &#39;musical&#39; vibe and want it to make sense. But to me those scenes feel deranged and out of place and that is exactly the point of it. In his head he is the entertainer/joker and she reawakens that imagination while he finds himself in reality is such a grim place. She wants him to escape for real, he just wants to escape through the idea of beeing loved. Like in the first movie he is quite estrangend from reality. Also I feel that the main message, how badly Arthur is struggling with his alter ego and his true self, is highlighted by the love story that (spoiler alert) turns out to be a scam because she only loves him for joker. It&#39;s not a classic super hero/villain story, it is not a musical, it is a deeply saddening story of a person abused as child, who escapes through imagination,  struggling to keep in touch with reality. With a few different choices this could have been another masterpiece, because to me the idea, the cinematography and the acting were actually very much on point. The movie seems to me very much misunderstood, just like Arthur, and maybe that makes it genius after all."

@made0041,2024-10-09T21:03:14Z,2024-10-09T21:08:53Z,4,"Am I the only one who actually liked the movie? Granted, I love musicals and the theatrical sort of Baz Luhrmann cinematic style, but I think the crazyness of them randomly breaking out into song and these different &quot;dream sequences&quot; with the Joker singing and dancing are a great representation of them living in their own fantasy world, and when he stops singing and asks her to as well, but she doesn&#39;t, was really meaningful, too. I don&#39;t know, I liked it.<br><br>Edit: Another thing, Joker&#39;s catch phrase, at least Heath Ledger&#39;s Joker, is literally &quot;Why so serious&quot;. So, cutting the tension of the serious scenes with random singing and dancing, I think is the perfect picture of what Joker represents. But I do admit I wish they had been WAY more transparent with this basically being a musical, a completely different genre than the first one, that obviously won&#39;t appeal to the same exact audience, who had been looking forward to it. I still liked it, though."

@HankingMySchrader,2024-10-09T19:28:05Z,2024-10-09T19:28:05Z,2,2 years of hype from the script being confirmed to the set photos to the trailers all to come out now and disappoint everyone
@bunniesandbeauty700,2024-10-09T19:20:30Z,2024-10-09T19:20:30Z,1,"I wish they would have been more transparent with their fans that this is a MUSICAL. I had no idea what I was in for. I don’t like musicals to begin with but this one was exceptionally painful to sit through. So. Many. Songs!! So much intentionally terrible, off key, raspy singing!! By the end I was ready to walk out. Barely a break in between numbers and any time something serious seemed to be happening they would start singing or performing some bizarre number and totally shatter the emotional tension of the scene. If the singing hadn’t been nearly incessant, if there had been decent breaks in between, it might have been tolerable. But they laid it on so thick it was unbearable. Like two hours of nails on a chalkboard."

It&#39;s because people have expectations for how it should end, which is mostly probably an epic ending, or a happy ending. But this movie subvert all expectations, because it shows a darker, sad, &amp; bad ending. Movies like this are such a very rare exceptions, especially today, because it bravely defies all the &#39;escapism&#39; fantasy like in most entertainment, fictions, &amp; works of art. This movie actually portrays the harsh reality very much, in fact, it is very close to what happens to our everyday&#39;s real world. Maybe this is the much deeper reason why people subconsciously hate this movie: because it simply reminds them of the harsh, bleak, cold, cruel, &amp; depressing reality. But for me, it&#39;s actually perfect, because again, it&#39;s extremely very rare to find a movie/film that is not just as a mere escapism &amp; entertainment, but actually really portrays &amp; shows the cruel reality. <br>- from Indonesia -"

@sehu1291,2024-10-09T02:49:37Z,2024-10-09T02:50:56Z,3,"Give the film a chance. Just be prepared for a film in Arkham Asylum and in court with dream sequences. Don&#39;t expect an action film. The director knew what people would hate about the film. When they were dancing and singing in the show, the audience suddenly got quiet and Lee said to Joker: &quot;The audience doesn&#39;t like what we&#39;re doing here, let&#39;s give them what they want and the music stopped and a violent scene was shown. Just like at the end he tells her to please stop singing, he covered her mouth but she just wouldn&#39;t stop. He asks because the director knew that the audience didn&#39;t want that either. The film plays with the audience&#39;s expectations. <br><br>Arthur is not THE Joker. He&#39;s not intelligent, he&#39;s not a criminal genius, he&#39;s just a mentally ill loser. Nothing more. He&#39;s an insignificant nobody. That was already clearly shown in part 1, but many viewers didn&#39;t get it and got it right in the face in this film who Arthur is. A loser. A nobody. You don&#39;t have to like a film, but anyone who talks about a disaster didn&#39;t understand Arthur Fleck and Part 1."

I think the biggest thing people didn’t like was the singing. I admit there were parts where they broke out in song when they could’ve went deeper into the storyline. But, that didn’t ruin the movie for me. People said that they walked out because it was so bad which I find to be exaggerating. Other than the musical parts, I did like the movie. If you are expecting violence in this movie u will be disappointed but if you understand what the movie really is about and Arthur’s character, you would like this movie."

Everything that the first part had, i.e. action, tension, expression, pantomime, laughter, was killed. The second part is gloomy, slow, boring, the joker smokes a cigarette throughout the entire film. It&#39;s a musical. Mrs. Gage was hired and kitsch was created. The Joker who doesn&#39;t laugh. It&#39;s a sad mistake, not a movie."

@MotionPicScripts,2024-10-09T00:29:59Z,2024-10-09T00:29:59Z,0,I give it a 5.0 just because the ending was terrible. And half the movie was both of them singing songs which made a little like a musical. But the acting was really well done on both Joaquin phenox and lady gaga. She played so well her role. I can’t believe she broke up with him towards the end I was so sad they had a crazy bond

@estarguars8260,2024-10-08T01:47:15Z,2024-10-08T01:47:15Z,3,I&#39;m so glad the movie bombed. Not a fan of musicals and dude Gaga.
@Smiyna,2024-10-08T01:43:54Z,2024-10-08T01:43:54Z,12,This is the best Joker sequel for me. Kudos to Mr. Phoenix. This one is closer to reality. Some were just born to suffer. What a very crippling sadness I felt after watching them.
@black.scorpion4444,2024-10-08T01:42:22Z,2024-10-08T01:42:22Z,4,Joker 1 touched my life when I was suffering

@cato451,2024-10-07T22:24:17Z,2024-10-07T22:24:17Z,8,Saw it today. Worst movie I’ve seen in decades.
@123prova,2024-10-07T22:23:08Z,2024-10-08T05:14:31Z,0,Just watched the movie. A weird feeling because while I realized it was a bad movie there was still something good with it. The quality and the  actors are clearly good but the message delivered is confusing. I hope there is something I missed. If I didn&#39;t ....then the movie is not worth watching. I felt like a reiteration of the concepts explored in the first movie...just with another method of screenplay and at an extremely low pace. Maybe the way it is constructed it is too technical or artistic to be properly understood by me (something like heavy Jazz music or some of those weird paintings....or Mulholland Drive).

@Lord_HawHaw,2024-10-07T13:43:59Z,2024-10-07T13:43:59Z,2,"Just finished watching “Joker: Folie à Deux.” <br><br>The success of the first film is that it directly tapped into a socio-political undercurrent marked by societal frustration with issues pertaining to how we address mental and behavioral health, social welfare, and class disparity. It also appealed to those who have felt as though they have been the victim of social, political, health, and judicial systems that have allowed them to fall through the cracks and failed them. <br><br>To that end, people came to identify with Arthur Fleck. I remember watching it in the theater when the first one came out, and when he killed Murray- the crowd literally applauded and cheered the man that the film had just been building up to be the “Big Bad.” And because of that, the film was a massive success. <br><br>Obviously, the producers and writers (and we will just say the powers that be) felt that “Joker” appealed to the - let’s just say “wrong target audience”- and that they needed an unnecessary sequel intentionally written to destroy every aspect of the first that audiences loved. Look it up- they intentionally wrote the second to erode the pillars that made the first such a success and Arthur Fleck a type of folklore hero. <br><br>“Joker: Folie à Deux” is a humiliation ritual for an audience held captive who wanted a continuation of the first film’s success. And all of the legitimate appeal that the first had regarding the issues affecting the disenfranchised and harried masses was tossed aside, and the sentiments felt by the audience goers spit back in their faces. <br><br>And then Hollywood wonders why their initial projections for box office sales had to be negatively adjusted 60% lower….<br><br>Today, more than ever- We are all clowns. <br><br>🤡"

Unsatisfied that his character has become infamous and taken on a life of its own, he set out to destroy his own character&#39;s legacy.  Both Philips and Cervantes kill off their creations in an ignominious manner, after the characters renounce their ways.  But just as Quixote&#39;s legacy continued despite Cervantes&#39; best efforts, so will the legacy of Joker despite this travesty of a movie."

@rei2684,2024-10-06T16:26:02Z,2024-10-06T16:29:25Z,1,"I think it would have been better if half the songs got cut out and instead building up to a song at the end that result to a plot twist more. Like at the first movie we had some dance scene , which were good, not too many, short and fit for the scenes. And it perfectly build up to the dance at the talk show his dance there up.<br>But joker 2 there is the build up missing to a scene that connects it all and instead feels more overused . Even if it was on purpose having the songs feel overwhelming and overuse, thats fine they could have use it to have a breakdown scene were joker demands that the music stops, like the staircase scene but more impactfull, something so it feels rewarding to been through evey song so we could have this one key scene that satisfy us.<br>But no we didn&#39;t get that"

However, I wouldn&#39;t say I liked the direction of the film&#39;s plot, How I thought it would have gone is<br><br> <del>start</del>  <br><del>joker in prison</del> <br><del>joker meets Dr. Harley</del> <br><del>they gain a romantic relationship</del> <br><del>they lead each other further into each other&#39;s madness as the trial goes on</del> <br><del>Harley breaks Joker out of whatever/prison/court</del>  <br><del>we end off with what regular joker would be</del>   <br><br> I believe that the musical was a good part though they should have advertised that more because it seemed some people didn&#39;t know but I&#39;ll continue on, it was a good way to show off the love he had for Harley feeding into the fantasy and escape that he feels with her. <br><br><br>Originally as I saw this being released I thought it was interesting. how I saw the 2019 Joker film was how people use comedy to mask and soothe the trauma and sadness from events in our lives, and how now in Folie a deux people use music to express love and passion <br><br>overall it could have been something better.  ehrm...... womp womp this movie sucked <br><br>💩💩💩"

The sales and ratings are abysmal as a direct result of this strategy, and it is possible WB will lose $200 million on this if you take marketing into account.  Shareholders should launch a class action lawsuit, as the WB board are putting their own woke ideology ahead of what is best for the company, which is a clear breach of fiduciary duty &amp; is damaging both the brand and the company value."

@jorgerivera5374,2024-10-06T04:13:27Z,2024-10-06T04:13:27Z,2,"It’s a masterpiece! &amp; I don’t think people are deep enough to truly appreciate it. Arthur fleck is Batman’s half brother &amp; Batman’s dad ironically created the inevitable real joker. Arthur never experienced love , not from his mom or anyone, that sadness that loneliness and utter despair is the entire point. Arthur is a good person a victim , someone we all had empty for in part 1 and throughout. The Folie a deux is French for two crazy people delusional together . He’s delusional believing she truly loves him for who he is as Arthur Fleck, and she’s delusional for loving the joker side of him even tho that’s not really him because he’s a good guy and not even the real joker after all. The midget even said you were always good to me. It was Arthur’s redemption, but when he went searching for Harley the tragedy is she doesn’t love who he really is and Arthur died alone never expecting love. Arthur doesn’t make the direct connection that maybe he could get love if he continues the joker persona and is never presented that opportunity, maybe he would have kept being the joker if it meant he could be loved by Harley, we will never know. When he sees Harley with make up is faded away as Arthur fleck this weak man who came out at closing statement is not attractive to Harley, that’s why she left him alone in the courtroom as she herself realizes in the end that it was all a fantasy &amp; he isn’t the joker. In the end he is the origin story &amp; inspiration of the real joker , the guy who kills him in the end and cuts smile on his face is the Joker who battles Batman not Arthur fleck."

@emazur8394,2024-10-06T01:45:41Z,2024-10-06T01:45:41Z,3,"The first Joker, though bleak, was fantastic. I was looking forward to Joker 2 but when I saw the trailer at the theater nothing made me want to see it. I saw it anyway and what you see is what you&#39;ll get. It&#39;s a very flat movie and little of interest happens. The unadvertised musical bits (which really don&#39;t take up that much airtime) sadly are probably the better parts of the movie. Harley Quinn the character was pretty flat in this one (it&#39;s not Lady Gaga&#39;s fault). Definitely not like the eccentric character from the Batman animated series. If you want a Harley Quinn movie, watch Birds of Prey (2020) instead. Joker 2 at best is a 2-star movie. If you intend to see it, if it hasn&#39;t caught your interest within the first 30 or 40 minutes it never will and I&#39;d recommend bailing out."

The idea that he couldn&#39;t carry on with what the Joker represented, and someone else came along to take his place after they realized that is really interesting, especially since the first Joker set him up as a mentally diseased guy who hit the right audience at the right time in the right way, not some mastermind of an ideology.<br><br>This could&#39;ve been great"

@subhayuepaul,2024-10-04T19:39:07Z,2024-10-04T19:39:07Z,0,"The Joker sequel, if we approach it from a psychoanalytic and ideological perspective, reflects a deeper exploration of the failures of contemporary society, but it doesn’t merely continue the narrative from the first film. Rather, it accentuates the original&#39;s critique of neoliberalism while exposing even more sharply the hidden underside of our political unconscious.<br><br>Arthur Fleck, in this sequel, no longer represents merely the victim of systemic violence; he becomes the embodiment of a certain enjoyment—what Lacan calls jouissance. The chaos he instigates is not just social anarchy, but a direct manifestation of repressed desires bubbling up from beneath the surface of modern capitalist society. In this sense, the Joker isn’t just a villain or antihero. He’s the symptom of a decaying ideology—an ideology that still maintains its appearance of order but is crumbling at its core.<br><br>This sequel deepens the tension between individual and system. Arthur’s descent into madness, violence, and chaos becomes the logical outcome of a system that can no longer conceal its contradictions. Joker’s actions are not isolated acts of rebellion but the culmination of a societal failure where the individual’s madness is a mirror of the larger collective madness.<br><br>Yet, the film does not offer a clear revolutionary path. In true Žižekian fashion, it leaves us with the uncomfortable realization that our desires for change often lack form, that the systems we rail against are not easily destroyed, and that chaos without structure offers no alternative vision. Joker, in his madness, points to a deeper truth: the system itself is insane, and yet, perversely, it functions.<br><br>The film’s brilliance lies in how it forces us to confront this uncomfortable reality, how it reveals that perhaps the real joke is on us—the audience, still searching for meaning, revolution, and redemption within a system that thrives on our discontent."

I just saw about several clips, the backlash, and read the plot. And I must say this movie really lost its edge the first one had in terms of direction. Some movies just don’t need a sequel.

Honestly pure 💩 compared to his first when he shot that tv host. 1/3 of movie was dramatic singing and other very streched court and jail drama. Very disapointed. I understand this is part of story and its important but still very disapointing

@grimreapergrimreaper8228,2024-10-04T05:00:15Z,2024-10-04T05:00:15Z,3,"Wow, this was kind of a lockdown. I was kind of disappointed with this. First of all, no offense to Lady Gaga, but she&#39;s no Margot Robbie secondly. I was looking forward so much to see this movie and I got a musicaland then I didn&#39;t really care for the ending. I was just a big lockdown. I was not the same movie.  That the first one was. It didn&#39;t have the same appeal. Everything I think everybody left the show dis appointed. I don&#39;t remember hearing 1 person saying that was a great movie. I could see the disappointment on people&#39;s faces. At this movie really dropped the ball and it&#39;s a big leapt down. It was like a slap in the face here. The music was good. Don&#39;t get me wrong. The music seems for good but.  I wanted the joker. I wanted to see more of what the original movie was not A. The joker musical, if they&#39;re going to make it the joker musical, then call it the joker musical. Oh, it&#39;s just kind of a wet down. I hate to say that I was really looking forward to this movie. I just said.  Lady Gaga, God what&#39;s good? Don&#39;t get me wrong. I loved her songs um, but she just snowmar Robbie and like I said, I was just a big lot down. I&#39;m not even going to give a spoiler, but does it say yeah, that was just a big lap down. I don&#39;t think a lot of people are gonna go see this movie because words gonna get out about how big of a letdown this movie was.  I&#39;m gonna give it a −1 score at 13 perfect scores. I wanted to give a 13 skull straight across-the-board but I can&#39;t. Maybe with the singing. I&#39;ll give it a one scale, but that&#39;s about everything else was just a big let down"

@rickyzeraus9748,2024-10-04T03:55:44Z,2024-10-04T03:55:44Z,1,The only reason this movie is good....its because their actors like Joaquin Phoenix and lady gaga acting it is marvelous...otherwise this movie would have been a musical disaster hehe i skipped only when they were singing.... besides all the story and the end wasn&#39;t really what a real joker story it supposed to be...so again thanks to these incredible actors the movie was good but not great.

Beautiful picture, great cast, amazing music, isn&#39;t that what we all need? I guess this time Gaga showed the crazy side of hers, and it was good! &quot;Let&#39;s give people what they want!&#39;&quot; No more words! This is the best movie of 2024.

Just watched this movie and it was the biggest disappointment in Joker history. The acting was great. The story line had potential but it was like the writer wanted to do acid and add music to it. Probably made since to him but literally nobody else. It ends horribly and leaves you confused. Why did you ruin this movie.

@ArijitianAS,2024-10-03T08:56:48Z,2024-10-03T08:58:20Z,4,Saw it today. It&#39;s an average sequel and the length makes it boring as well. Climax is a bit predictable and the movie is nothing in comparison to the first one. It lacks brutality and is filled with music. It just focuses on giving a depth to the character of Arthur Fleck but that too made him look weak and foolish. <br>I would rate this movie 4/10 ⭐.<br>They could really have done a much better job 😕.

@shobhitsharma3217,2024-10-03T04:59:14Z,2024-10-03T05:12:34Z,3,"Joker 2 was a travesty except cinematography, rewatched joker 1 12 hours prior to watching joker 2 and regretted it big time.<br> <br>My  plot that could have  justified Joker 2 as true sequel . The first 5 minutes would have shown Joker&#39;s routine in the asylum, completely overshadowed by his Joker identity. The next 15 minutes would focus on court hearings, and then Harley would be introduced as Joker&#39;s psychiatrist. Over time, Joker&#39;s mindset would greatly influence Harley&#39;s identity, leading to her transformation from a normal mindset to a crazy one. Before the interval, a group of Joker&#39;s admirers breaks into the asylum and helps Joker escape. The second half of the plot would show Joker, Harley, and the group revolting against the system, leading to riots and punishing the wealthy with heinous acts.<br><br>Meanwhile, if they wish to recreate the scene from the first part where Bruce Wayne&#39;s story unfolds, they could depict the Joker walking into a palace and setting it on fire . The camera angle could show Bruce and Alfred witnessing the Joker&#39;s crazy  act for the first time, setting the stage for their future  rivalry. As for the ending, they could show the Joker and Harley isolating themselves from the city for a significant period after their destructive acts, or perhaps depict the Joker and Harley having a baby, setting the stage for Robert&#39;s Batman to face a similarly aged Joker (Arthur would not be alive). In a post-credit scene a few years later, they could show a new Joker wreaking havoc once again, with the camera angle revealing the shade  of Robert watching it , leading into Batman 3."

It should have been named Arthur Fleck instead who is just a dumb, naive and predictable character in comparison with the first one along with having ZERO confidence as well when wearing the Joker suit and makeup for lame reasons. And there&#39;s literally the decline of characters instead of development. The song and dream sequences aren&#39;t profound at all and yet ridicilious, corny, awkward and boring. The movie clearly expects the audience to be stupid considering the explanation and justification of the acts of the first one, which only worked in the first one because of the mystique, imagination and myth of its dark tone while being in an exciting pace unlike this one. A dull and boring buildup made it lose its glamour early on and Arthur&#39;s realtionship with Lee/Harley has no significance at the end and was just a waste of time and story... Nice way to ruin an intriguing character of Joker overall..."

@alshey4056,2024-10-02T08:19:30Z,2024-10-02T08:28:14Z,0,"The most amateur move this production could’ve done was give Gaga a role. She’s a singer, that’s what people know her for. Throwing her into a Sci-Fi or Action flick where she’s got zero cred was a boneheaded move by the producers. Her acting is just her being herself, not the character she’s supposed to play. She straight-up can’t act. The trailer looks like a Gaga musical, not an actual movie. Why? Because wherever she goes, her &quot;pop star&quot; baggage, style and image comes with her. Joaquin&#39;s awesome, I loved Joker 1, but then, here, I am seeing a musical with Lady Gaga, tbh."

Never ever cross-mix celebrities from different industries where they&#39;re already &quot;branded&quot;. Gaga is known for singing, stage it there, where people see her as a singer and not an actor. Plus, Gaga does not bring any unique talent on the acting stage or method to shape the character. She hasn&#39;t done enough action or sci fi movies. It&#39;s just plain vanilla her. Gaga comes with an established brand and image of her own, and where ever she goes, that image goes with her. This being said, the movie now looks like a Gaga Broadway musical."

Especially she&#39;s gonna look bad near Phoenix&#39;s Joker. First joker movie was made with passion. This one looks like made with calculations and to earn money

@mik3yztv378,2024-09-23T18:13:21Z,2024-09-23T18:13:21Z,5,Ewww... This version of Harley Quinn is gonna be disappointing
@DaDirtyDiggler,2024-09-23T18:01:33Z,2024-09-23T18:01:33Z,1,"She looks like Hillary Clinton, mah aswel of cast her, you guys delusional"
@Revenant74,2024-09-23T17:44:44Z,2024-09-23T17:44:44Z,1,"BBC was part of the selected early screening reviewers. BBC reviews that a lot of things you see in the movie is just the imagination of Arthur and this sequel delievers the message that Fleck is a wimpy, self-centred stooge who lets down everyone around him. He&#39;s a nobody. Depending on how you look at it, this demythologising exercise is either daring or it&#39;s irritatingly smug, but it&#39;s definitely not much fun. Phillips seems to be saying that if you fell for Fleck&#39;s Messianic self-image the last time around, then the joke&#39;s on you."

In this story, Batman takes on his first mission, trying to stop the Joker and Harley Quinn. The title &#39;Umbra Chiroptera&#39; translates to &#39;Shadow of the Bat&#39; in Latin, symbolizing Batman&#39;s emergence from the shadows as he begins his endless psychological battle with the Joker. The movie would dive deep into their twisted dynamic, full of mental tricks, traps, and the dark journey that defines their conflict."

@jimmytaylor3089,2024-09-16T02:02:02Z,2024-09-16T02:04:53Z,0,The first one was amazing. It will have to go down as a cult classic as it ages. I don’t see how the first can possibly live up to the expectations of the second but I’ll definitely be watching it.<br>Edit: Hollyweird hasn’t made a film great enough for the theater in years. All propaganda films pushing some half twisted agenda. We can hope they don’t destroy the legacy of the first!!!

@paulpazsak3665,2024-09-14T12:25:02Z,2024-09-14T12:26:07Z,0,The original creator of the Joker made him a character that represents chaos and destruction with no name and unknown origin. Which I like the first movie. Making the joker a relatable human being takes away from the mystery the joker is supposed to be. Which makes his villian arc less scary. Just looks like a mentally ill lonely crackhead in these movies. Hollywood nowadays loves to be empathetic to the &quot;misunderstood villain&quot;. So we cna relate to them. To break down our society and Co sign anarachy<br>This movie looks like 2020 riots. <br>Heath Ledger is by the best actor that played the real Joker in a live action movie.

I like the original story. Now that would be a great movie. I’m not a fan of most the actors and singers in this. I’m sure I’ll get some hate. Because I’ve read the comments. But I don’t care. Not my joker. I’ll probably still watch it on tv. But that’s gonna be it.

I&#39;ll still see it and I&#39;ll probably enjoy it just like the first, but let&#39;s be honest here. The only reason they&#39;re the success and likely success that they are is because they&#39;re piggybacking on the 2 biggest named Batman villians there are. If it wasn&#39;t called Joker nobody would have seen it."

She made a huge impact in reforming patients at Arkham.  <br>The joker recognized that she was essentially their slave.  Dealing with the patients no one else wanted to deal with.  <br>Which is why she got the joker as a patient.  Joker played the part of a reforming inmate.<br>Once Harley Quinn demostrated her methods we&#39;re effective.  It was her supervisor that took credit for all of her work.  <br>That is what broke Harley.  That is when joker was able to open the door in her mind into becoming an agent of chaos. <br>I know the comics and animated series are not movie canon.  It&#39;s just a shame to see such a complex character get reduced down."

I am worried that, it being a sequel, it&#39;s going to be one of those movies that takes everything that organically worked for the first movie, force it, and hammer it into the ground for this one.  As artsy as the first one was, it could really make this one bad.  Hopefully, with it being more of a musical type, they make it it&#39;s own piece of art, so it works organically like the first one."

And its only by sheer luck that no one has died from the assaults he has committed upon them as a vigilante.  Joker knows batman is sick, Batman is in denial of it."

It received only 52 points out of 100, usually if critics give such a low rating, then the user will be about 30 out of 100. According to critics, the film does not complement the first part, which was a finished work and it is generally unclear why it was filmed.😜"

Joker was perfection not ot mention it was never meant to be a DC movie. So yo go and you make a sequel nobody asked for. Then you have to go and make it a musical. If that wasn&#39;t bad enough to really and I mean really rub salt in that wound you had to use Lady Gaga of all people. This is a hard pass for me.

@blueboxsketch,2024-09-08T07:58:01Z,2024-09-08T07:58:01Z,2,I think the problem with this movie will be gaga. The literal lengths phoenix went to in the first film to make a mentally ill on screen performance was outstanding. I&#39;m not going to expect the same in the second because gaga although a &quot;advocate for wierdos&quot; accepts people who is mentally ill however doesn&#39;t understand what makes a person that way. It comes across in the trailer.

Instead of some old hag who isn&#39;t even relevant these days, why not an actual attractive woman? Harley is more than just insane Hollywood. Y&#39;all can find ANYONE off the streets up there who can act (not pretend) crazy. Put the effort in to find someone attractive who is also pittyable.

Is a world-renowned pop star who can barely hit any notes in the promo. Going to change this for us? Is this movie going to be about two feminine weirdos who can barely reach a note so that the rest of you can feel good about yourselves? Kind of strange that this movie isn&#39;t a comedy. 🤔

@IconicPicturesInternational,2024-09-01T18:55:17Z,2024-09-01T18:55:17Z,1,"Somebody at an executive level interfered and sabotaged this sequel. It is focused more on trying to attract a &quot;new&quot; audience than satisfying the audience it already has. As a result of the executive level narcissism and self serving ideology, the film mixes genres in a way that conflicts. The IP&#39;s core strength and concept has been gutted. It looks like an empty shell of it&#39;s former self. I LOVED the original, but cannot feel in my gut the desire to see this. As is so common these days with Hollywood films. They rarely appeal to my instincts and to the core of my being as the films once did. Instead they are trying to appeal to some cognitive, intellectual, social justice ideology that is keeping filmmakers stuck in their heads."

@spicychick411,2024-08-31T01:48:02Z,2024-08-31T01:48:02Z,2,Lady Gaga kinda ruined Harley Quinn for me. Harley Quinn is supposed to be chaos not as calm and quiet as a little mouse. I know I&#39;m going to be bombarded with all the hate but Gaga really was a bad choice to me for this role. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll see this in theaters

At the end of the day, Warner Bros puts the money in your pocket and goodbye? <br><br>This game helped not only me, but many people with depression, which is a very common disease these days, people who loved and loved the game who bet everything to see the game grow, people streaming on twitch and the game grew more and more, but it wasn&#39;t enough for Warner Bros. <br><br>I hope you manage to get out of this crisis you&#39;re going through, the stock market is getting worse and worse, I wish you every success but don&#39;t rob people, don&#39;t rob workers, people who put money into games for the first time and you just took it all."

Not sure how the introduction of a toxic romance will work. Mabye it about how a mentally ill person can be mulnipulated by people around them. Whether that&#39;s the a romantic partner or movements of people on the internet. <br><br>The joker from the previous movie seemed to relish the love of his followers even if he never really was intending to start a movement, but liked the attention and love. Maybe this new one will be about how he gets get caught up in the music of the crowd and the romance of it all and end up doing terrible things."

They jail criminals after killing so many innocent lives just to be released again to kill, where they could put them down for good.

Not a criminally insane psychopath genius... Its an alright movie but not really joker... I mean how does this fuy foght off a superhero like Batman... Like you punch him in the face and its over pretty much
@TylerHines-dy8yg,2024-07-29T01:55:08Z,2024-07-29T01:55:08Z,5,My theory about Harvey Dent in this movie:<br>Maybe he’s the main antagonist.<br>Maybe he’ll pursue Arthur throughout.<br>Maybe his defeat will be Arthur causes the accident that turns him into Two-Face.

Who knows."

Joker&#39;s worst weapons are his charisma, his intellect and the complete unpredictability of his actions so as Joaquin Phoenix really brings all this out of the Joker... all i gotta say in the end is : Grow up Baby Batman!

And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.” 1 John 1:8-10 If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. If we say we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.

So haunting and dark in a very different way then ever presented before. Giving you a real insight into the mindset of the crazy of them. This could be Oscar worthy for sure, only time will tell. But it looks like movie of the year.  I think Gaga will be fine for Harley as it&#39;s a musical and she brings a very different verrsion of Harley just like Joker. But to me this is much more realistic and haunting then any other version. Which is what makes it so good. Really looking forward to it."

@LivermoreFilm,2024-07-26T12:38:03Z,2024-07-26T12:38:03Z,121,Not sure if you caught this: &quot;I&#39;ve got this sneaking suspicion that we&#39;re not giving the people what they want&quot; is extremely meta. This line is for all the people (not excluding myself) that scratches their head with &quot;joker 2 is a musical? wtf?&quot;. And when Harley says &quot;let&#39;s give the people what they want&quot; is a PROMISE we will not be let down on this film. I am excited and hope the film delivers exactly what the trailer promises. The overseer and director of this trailer is ON-POINT and has the audience in mind. Much applause!

@AlaahAkbr-q9c,2024-07-26T12:19:37Z,2024-07-26T12:19:37Z,1,"God loves you and cares for you so that this message reaches you. God is the one who created this large universe and controls it completely. The greatest loss a person loses in this life is that he lives without knowing God who created him and knowing the Messenger of Muhammad, the last of the messengers, and the Islamic religion, the last of the heavenly religions.  Great intelligence, before you believe in something or not, is to read it, study it, and understand it well, and after that you have the choice to believe in it or not to believe in it. I advise you to do this now, before you no longer have time to do so. Life is very short. It is just a test, just a passage to eternal life. Great advice to those who...  Understands"

@danclover5194,2024-07-26T02:16:07Z,2024-07-26T02:16:07Z,0,"Joker is one of my all time favorite movies.was told it was a rip off of taxi driver and &quot;king of comedy&quot; never really bought into the taxi driver idea cuz its like Arthur is positive and hopeful in a way while Travis Bickle is just bitter right from the opening dialogue .. felt it a different tone entirely … after this trailer I watched &quot;King of Comedy &quot; and that movie is the first Joker but way better .. the scenes flow seamlessly from dream state to reality , you have no idea what is really going on and the ending was actually great that the comedy standup was funny by Robert Dinero  and the whole movie youre lead to believe hes not.. this new joker film looks like just a further continuation of Arthurs delusions… I honestly believe the &quot;joke&quot; the therapist wouldn&#39;t get at end of the first film , is the whole movie we watched was just some daydream of Arthur in Arkham asylum ,, he dreamed he got famous,  and everyone loved him that&#39;s &quot;how he got there&quot; .but in reality hes just a lunatic.  I feel like at the end of this second film it will be revealed that the entire two movies weren&#39;t real… I believe this because after watching KofC you see that Robert Deniro Character is revered after going to jail and he comes back to a screaming audience yelling his name and they say it 8 times. throughout the movie , no one remembers his name , Hes invisible and forgettable, so its all just a big fantasy still going on in his head even from prison imo..reading about this movie Todd Phillips used KOFC as heavy influence for Joker, so the idea that none of the first movie happened and the second is even further into his delusions makes sense for a good finale."
@BlaknGold09,2024-07-26T02:14:28Z,2024-07-26T02:39:10Z,0,At what point do we see this criminal mastermind emerge?  He seems a far cry from that at this point.  Im a fan of Pheonix&#39;s portrayal of the Joker and the elements of the Joker that he captures masterfully...but when does the psycopathic criminal mastermind emerge and he actually becomes full blown Joker.  That we have yet to see and im hoping we finally do at some point in this movie but im getting a little restless here and im wondering how they are gonna take this Joker and do that.  Crazy he has...insane....i can give him that as well...but smart....not at all and how are they gonna make this guy here a criminal master mind?  That part is what im having trouble seeing develope.  This is where Heath Ledgers Joker set himself apart and im hoping that Pheonix&#39;s Joker can become that somehow although im having a hard time wrapping mty head around how THIS Joker is just gonna magically transform into someone who can outsmart or out think Bruce Wayne/Batman.  The intellect just isnt there and explaining how this Joker GETS that intellect is gonna be a real challenge.  Batman would completely obliterate him mentally and physically as it stands right now thus making it impossible for this Joker to ever be the arch nemesis of the Dark Knight.

Instead she&#39;s a makeup designer too so its like she doesn&#39;t even care about making music anymore really.

Great movie, but it doesn&#39;t deserve the name Joker because the fans except something entirely different"

I don’t think people realize just how difficult it is for a normal person to play a 100% convincing character who’s borderline insane with multiple conditions that alter their mental state. I’ve never seen an actor make laughing look like a conditionally forced tick like he can. Can’t wait for this movie, I genuinely hope lady gaga can play the psycho Harley we’re all hoping for."

@ltlbear05,2024-07-24T23:21:39Z,2024-07-24T23:21:39Z,0,I am in the minority here but I am not sold on Gaga as Harley. I know she’s a good singer but I am worried about her acting performance as Harley. I loved her in A Star is a Born but Harley is such an iconic character and I don’t see how Gaga is going to measure up. I hope I’m wrong.

Bad casting. Get an actual actor. Hopefully she sings more than acts in the movie, because it is, in the end, just stunt casting."

The lack of singing indicates the latter and I just don&#39;t see it translating.  I say it under performs at about domestic + international of 450 Million where it flat lines....just barley getting a profit.   Sadly nothing about the trailer grabbed me, with the exception of lady gaga pelvic thrust at the end which I found honest and funny.  This movie should not released in October......it should be late August....its a summer movie, not a Halloween movie."

This UNDERFILM = TRASH must fail. I told you, but you didn’t read carefully, why they didn’t give an Academy Award to the 2018 film “Venom”?! These films are similar, plus or minus. Lady Gaga is not an actress, and Joaquin Phoenix is not an actor - he is a grimacing clown, like Tom Hardy, and plus he is the same in his acting from film to film where he appears. He, like Lady Gaga, is a disgrace to the Oscars. Jack Nicholson, Al Pacino, Daniel Day-Lewis, Anthony Hopkins and I don&#39;t want to go on (there are not many of them) are real actors, and real actresses are Meryl Streep, Halle Berry, Elizabeth Taylor, Octavia Spencer, Cate Blanchett. Right now, the Oscars and not only in movies are awarded either for skin color, or sexual orientation, or gender, or for antics and hackwork, like these two idiots, but NOT FOR TALENT.☝☝☝☝☝<br>SHAME AND FAILURE ON THIS TRASH MOVIE AND ALL THE OTHER TRASH MOVIES LIKE THIS!👍👍👍👍👍"

Long story short my ex and I got back together after years and it was great. Sadly she was taken before her time. The last movie we watched was Joker and I havnt been able to watch it since. 2 days ago I lost her prayer card and was devastated. At my all point low I saw this. And it was almost a sign from God. I&#39;ve cried 20x since and rewatched this like a thousand times<br>Tl;Dr: joker 2 saved my life and it isn&#39;t even out yet

They couldn&#39;t find someone from Britain, Australia, Canada, or wherever they usually love to cast from? Who is Lady Gaga, seriously, for such an important role? A half-singer whose main audience is the LGBT community, and now she has to act like she&#39;s an actor too? No, she&#39;s not a good actor, and she seems like a choice your mom would make if the dinner was burnt and she made sandwiches in a hurry to fill everyone’s bellies. Come on, DC."

@masterofmetal85,2024-07-24T15:38:29Z,2024-07-24T15:38:29Z,0,My only issue is you can&#39;t have a joker without a batman so if the movies keep going theyll be forced to introduce a version of batman. The dichotomy of batman and joker is almost like gospel and to negate one without the other is sacrilege. That&#39;s why every batman version introduces a version of joker

It has completely ruined the joker as far as the movie goes and now they have Lady Gaga of all people playing Harley Quinn. No. NO NO NO...  She doesn&#39;t fit the role AT ALL and is a complete spit in the face to the character. Stop now... Whoever casts her as Harley is an idiot  and clearly not a true fan nor knows anything about the characters. What a JOKE

@emar144,2024-07-24T05:14:30Z,2024-07-24T05:14:30Z,0,I think lady gaga&#39;s non conventional looks are perfect for this role but I don&#39;t think she is personally right for the role. Maybe a good actress who is not so well known would have been better.

@TheDaneist,2024-07-24T05:12:43Z,2024-07-24T05:12:43Z,0,This film will be perfect if there&#39;s a sinister realisation by fleck that he is manipulative and likes it. So far his character is mired in pity and his evil doesn&#39;t seem as evil because it&#39;s grounded with reasoning. If i see even hints of the actual comic joker in this it will without a doubt be a masterpiece. Evolution from a reasoned origin story into the psychopath we know  and love to hate.

Prioritizing the focus and narrative around the Joker, taking a deep dive into his philosophy and identity in his own world separate from Batman and anything related to DC Comics, is such a refreshing and engaging experience for me personally. The character has been connected to pretty much a blank canvas when it comes to background, storytelling, and development. For me, I’m thankful that the first movie was written well enough to bring more life and existence to the Joker. By the looks of things, this new film is shaping up to be a positive addition to the character of the Joker."

Stop doubting yourself and seeing the greatness in everyone else but you. You are better than that. You deserve more. Start showing up differently to yourself. Believe in yourself.

@MiloLaufeyjarson,2024-07-24T01:24:05Z,2024-07-24T01:24:05Z,0,Suicide Squad and Birds Of Prey gave us antihero Harley Quinn. Joker: Folie A Deux is giving us the classic villain Harley Quinn before she was retconned in 2011. And anyone whose seen the first film just knows automatically that her relationship with the Joker is going be more accurately portrayed than it was in 2016 Suicide Squad.

With a dumb blonde MTG for a consort. <br><br>The joker is ridiculously smart ! In fact the reason his stand-ups didn&#39;t work when he was normal was because it was way ahead and so cutting it went above his audience&#39;s heads. He knew all the flaws of the system but he was ok trying to make a life with his wife. <br><br>After his accident and the death of his wife, his smartness went from making jokes on the system to making a joke of the system. <br><br>There&#39;s a reason why they Batman is always nervous about his schemes. Joker knows the game as well as he does if not better. <br><br>There&#39;s a reason the Joker was able to make a psychiatrist like Harley Quinn fall for him. He was sharp as a diamond pretending to be a clown. <br><br>The joker which Joaquin Phoenix plays is just like any fool who feels the system is against him and goes on a rage spree. In the world 10 years ago, he would be put down. <br><br>The movie is more a commentary on MAGA America, it&#39;s supporters of nitwits, and the nonsense they are willing to believe and support than anything to do with the Joker."

He was always a psychopath you weren’t supposed to feel bad for cause he just wanted power and chaos. Some villains I’m okay with the sympathy angle, but others are a hard pass for me, and that’s what I think of these interpretations. Sure it’s basically not the joker and just borrowed inspiration, but they imply a lot of controversial messages in these movies to stir people into thinking joker is somehow a good guy."

I&#39;m not saying that it&#39;s some deep thing literally meant to mean &quot;Fully Adieu&quot; to anything.

It would have fitted the dark tragic theme of the movie to see her slowly lose her sanity over her love for the Joker.

I mean, is this exactly the kind of character that can stand up to anyone?"

He’s confident, even when he’s enraged. When Joker laughs, it’s because he thinks something is funny, but what Joker finds funny is usually terrible.<br><br>In the sequel perhaps he is torn. Does he want to be Joker or Arthur? Harley embraces and encourages him to be more Joker but I think we will see that he recognizes how this can harm her.<br><br>Also we see scenes that are almost certainly in Arthur’s mind like the Joker &amp; Harley show. Arthur realizes he’s losing his touch with reality. Does he hold on or let go?"

Recent psychiatric classifications refer to the syndrome as shared psychotic disorder (DSM-4 – 297.3) and induced delusional disorder (ICD-10 – F24), although the research literature largely uses the original name. The same syndrome shared by more than two people may be called folie à trois (&#39;three&#39;) or quatre (&#39;four&#39;); and further, folie en famille (&#39;family madness&#39;) or even folie à plusieurs (&#39;madness of several&#39;).<br><br>This disorder is not in the current, fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), which considers the criteria to be insufficient or inadequate. DSM-5 does not consider Shared Psychotic Disorder (folie à deux) as a separate entity; rather, the physician should classify it as &quot;Delusional Disorder&quot; or in the &quot;Other Specified Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorder&quot; category."

I guess its all part of the madness but this 1 looks like he might be off his meds &amp; not telling the story. AND is he the real Joker or will the Joker from the Batman story line be inspired by Arthur Fleck? They&#39;ll probably never answer any of those..."

Nothing about this guy strikes me as a brilliant mastermind with a flair for chaos. If anything he seems more like some weak guy that the joker would’ve convinced into snapping and lashing out at society. Also Harley not being an intelligent woman and having a doctorate in psychology in this is once again just disrespectful imo. Yeah she falls in love with crazy and goes crazy in the process but she’s actually incredibly smart. Here she’s just another broken person right from the beginning"

@Raven-HQ,2024-07-23T17:52:49Z,2024-07-23T17:52:49Z,0,The joker having to paint his face white is the least joker thing. Jared was a better joker with this and looked like he was going to release a rap album. <br><br>Not a fan of any of these DC properties they try to force to be “realistic”. It’s a freakin comic book it’s not suppose to be rooted in reality.

@domenicoloriggio7315,2024-07-23T17:45:08Z,2024-07-23T17:45:08Z,1,"Non finirò mai di ringraziare il mio migliore amico Nicola. All&#39; epoca del primo Joker ero un po&#39; chiuso nel mio angolino visto che film come V per Vendetta, 300, Sin City, Watchmen, i Batman di Burton e Nolan, Scott Pilgrim vs The World, la saga videoludica Batman Arkham, i due Injustice, Hulk di Ang Lee e relativo videogioco per PS2, Superhero, i film live action delle Tartarughe Ninja, La Leggenda degli Uomini Straordinari, Il Corvo, i due Gli Incredibili, Megamind, Smallville, Krypton, i film live action di Garfield e i due Hellboy di Del Toro erano ormai passati. E principalmente portavo in palmo di mano Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man, Into the Spider-verse, il DC animated universe, Invincible e The Boys (l&#39; Arrowverse aveva i suoi alti e bassi. Però almeno c&#39;era Superman &amp; Lois). Un giorno il mio migliore amico Nicola mi disse che al cinema davano un film chiamato &#39;Joker&#39;. Io ero scettico. &quot;Dai, Nico&#39;, un film su Joker senza Batman non potrebbe mai funzionare. Sarebbe come fare un film su Lex Luthor senza Superman&quot;. All&#39; uscita dal cinema Nicola mi disse che quel film ricordava molto &#39;Taxi Driver&#39; e &#39;Re per una notte&#39; (film che non ho mai visto, ndr). Nonostante non fosse una trasposizione del fumetto &#39;The Killing Joke&#39; (ancora grazie, Nello, per avermelo regalato) il primo Joker mi era piaciuto tantissimo. Nicola si ricorda ancora oggi che gli feci la testa ad acqua con Joker, Toy Story 4 e Rocketman.<br><br>Alla notizia che avrebbero fatto Joker 2 rimasi F4 basito. Cosa avrebbero mai potuto raccontare visto che il Joker di Phoenix e il Batman di Pattinson non erano collegati? Il primo trailer ha fugato qualche dubbio. &quot;Wow, allora mostrano decentemente, non come ha fatto il Suicide Squad di Ayer, come la dott.ssa Quinzeel è diventata Harley Quinn. E magari finalmente mostrano il rapporto tossico tra Joker e Harley Quinn&quot;.<br><br>Questo secondo trailer sembra aver confermato, però mi toccherà scoprirlo ad ottobre in sala, uno dei pronostici che avevo fatto per Joker 2: ci sarà un duello nell&#39; aula di tribunale tra Joker e Harley Quinn (che saranno visti come dei paladini) contro Harvey Dent che sarà una specie di Jack McCoy che magari mira a diventare sindaco di Gotham City (chi ha visto Law &amp; Order capirà).<br><br>Per il resto che dire... Ad inizio anno avevo detto che c&#39;erano solo tre film che aspettavo tantissimo, contando i secondi, allo stesso livello con cui ho aspettato ogni stagione di Attack On Titan e il Gear 5 nell&#39; anime di One Piece. E ora aspetto Death Stranding 2, GTA VI, Kingdom Hearts 4, Resident Evil 9 gioco, The Last of Us s2, House of the Dragon s3, The Boys s5, Michael e Verum Rex gioco. Quei film erano Joker 2, Il Gladiatore 2 e Sonic 3. Appuntamento tra 2 mesi e 12 giorni con Joker 2. Poi passerò al Gladiatore 2 e Sonic 3. Ma quella è un&#39; altra storia.<br><br>N.B. A molti miei conoscenti non piace il fatto che Joker 2 avrà elementi musicali. A me sta benissimo. Infatti ho visto addirittura dieci volte film come Barbie, Super Mario Bros il film, Aladdin cartone, Hercules cartone Disney, Elvis del 2022, i due Sing, La Bella e La Bestia cartone, La Sirenetta cartone, La Principessa e il Ranocchio, Il Gobbo di Notre Dame, il primo Rio, Rocketman, La La Land, Another Cinderella Story, A Cinderella Story Once Upon a Song, i tre Pitch Perfect e Bohemian Rhapsody. Ed è una cosa che ho riservato solo al primo American Pie, Shrek 2 e Superhero con Drake Bell. Comunque nessuno batterà mai la Fata Madrina che canta &#39;I Need a Hero&#39; in Shrek 2.<br><br>P.s. Non faccio previsioni in ottica Oscar. Soprattutto dopo che ho completamente cannato il risultato della finale degli europei di calcio Spagna-Inghilterra."

Just listen to the first film&#39;s soundtrack and tell me it&#39;s not a horror flick about a clown that kills people.<br>Even now, in this trailer, i hear an disharmonious sound, in the background i hear something threatening, sinister and in the front, almost trying to deafen the eerie tune, thus properly embodying what the film is about :<br>It&#39;s about a mad dangerous man being treated like a hero when he&#39;s really just a monster who will be stopped again and again by another mad man, except this one wears a silly bat costume and overall has a weird thing with bats. But since this is a movie about the joker, i reckon batman won&#39;t be showing up a lot wich is kind of ironic."

@VLFBERHTwolf,2024-07-23T17:18:33Z,2024-07-23T17:18:33Z,1,"You know, it&#39;s funny. This trailer reminds me of a joke. See, there were two guys locked in a lunatic asylum and one night ... one night, they decided they didn&#39;t like that anymore. They decided to escape. So, they made it up to the roof and there, just across this narrow gap, they see rooftops, stretching across town, stretching to freedom. Now, the first guy, he jumps right across, no problem. But his friend, oh, no way, he&#39;s afraid of falling. So, the first guy has an idea. He says, &quot;Hey, I got this flashlight with me. I&#39;ll shine it across the gap between the buildings and you can walk across the beam and join me.&quot; But the second guy says, &quot;What do you think I am, crazy? You&#39;ll just turn it off when I&#39;m halfway across!&quot;<br><br>I wonder what parts of this movie are real and what parts are a hallucination."

Imagine two people so close they start sharing the same crazy ideas. It’s like a twisted version of a shared Netflix account, but for delusions instead of TV shows. <br><br>Usually, one person is the primary, the originator of the delusion, and the other, the secondary, adopts these beliefs. It’s a fascinating and somewhat disturbing peek into how closely intertwined our minds can become with those we’re emotionally connected to. So, next time you think your roommate is making you crazy, you might be more right than you know. <br><br>In criminal cases, it typically appears in situations where two people commit crimes together and share delusional beliefs, often reinforcing each other’s paranoia or grandiosity. Think of infamous duos like Bonnie and Clyde or the Moors murderers, though not always diagnosed with Folie à Deux, their close relationships and shared delusions led to their criminal actions. And in this case, same thing happened with Arthur and soon to be his Harley queen in this trailer.<br><br>And depending on the situation and condition, it can transform into Folie à Plusieurs, or &quot;madness of many.&quot; This phenomenon occurs when one individual’s delusional beliefs spread to multiple people, often in a group setting. So, with that in mind, perhaps we might have chance for the third movie if joker madness and delusional ideology keep spreading in the movie like what we see in the trailer, but hey, that just a theory, a film theory.<br><br>Edit: the fastest I&#39;ve reached 1K likes and so many positives replies, thank you"

The thing I like the most about The joker is that we didn&#39;t know anything about his origin he was just a nutjob to be a nutjob. Nothing deep just straight up insanity. But nope now we gotta rationalize villians gotta make us sympathetic to mass murderers. Gtfo

So little modern media utilizes that part of her character and it&#39;s by far the most interesting part. It would have been so interesting, with the way Arthur&#39;s relationship with psychologists and other doctors was in the first movie, to see someone who genuinely wants to help him but also loves him for him, who comes to worship him like he&#39;s always wanted to be worshipped. Most modern Harleys are reduced to &quot;hot and crazy,&quot; and while I&#39;m certain Gaga&#39;s version will have layers, it seems like it&#39;s gonna be just more &quot;hot and crazy.&quot; That&#39;s a little disappointing."

The original film had a small budget, but more freedom because they didn&#39;t think it would make much money (especially since it was rated R). And they didn&#39;t want to make a sequel. If this is just a soulless attempt to recreate the first one I&#39;ll be pretty sad."

This UNDERFILM = TRASH must fail. I told you, but you didn’t read carefully, why they didn’t give an Academy Award to the 2018 film “Venom”?! These films are similar, plus or minus. Lady Gaga is not an actress, and Joaquin Phoenix is not an actor - he is a grimacing clown, like Tom Hardy, and plus he is the same in his acting from film to film where he appears. He, like Lady Gaga, is a disgrace to the Oscars. Jack Nicholson, Al Pacino, Daniel Day-Lewis, Anthony Hopkins and I don&#39;t want to go on (there are not many of them) are real actors, and real actresses are Meryl Streep, Halle Berry, Elizabeth Taylor, Octavia Spencer, Cate Blanchett. Right now, the Oscars and not only in movies are awarded either for skin color, or sexual orientation, or gender, or for antics and hackwork, like these two idiots, but NOT FOR TALENT.☝☝☝☝☝<br>SHAME AND FAILURE ON THIS TRASH MOVIE AND ALL THE OTHER TRASH MOVIES LIKE THIS!👍👍👍👍👍"

I am just unable to see any connection to it&#39;s source material, except for the names of locations and people. I kinda hope I am mistaken and the sequel will actually make it more &quot;Joker&quot; and less &quot;Joaquin&quot;."

Years later they force them to make another one as a musical.<br><br>They spend millions of dollars just on the actors, add the movie production cost, and everything needed.<br><br>Supposedly they brought in James Gunn to avoid disasters like this. Wasting crazy amounts of money on a pointless movies. <br><br>But DC or Warner has done it again.<br>Their excuse is that these movies and The Batman are separated from JamesGunn DC Universe.<br><br> Hopefully if this movie fails it doesn&#39;t affects the budget for the new Superman and Batman movies.

Why?! Why can&#39;t u just keep an already amazing character simple, why tf do i have to have confusion ilof the joker being some saviour villan who introduced to new existential philosophies , influencing politics and being in love! This Gotham series had good Joker character"

@galavantgambitgaming,2024-07-23T15:36:38Z,2024-07-23T15:36:38Z,0,I&#39;m really curious as to why Joker ran up on himself looking worried. Is that really him in his head tryna get him back in the game? Is it a fan who recognized him? And if it is in his head...what happened? He&#39;s in the middle of what looks like chaos and is still unhappy? A very different Joker indeed. We&#39;ve nvr been in a verse where not only does the Joker quite possibly have the voice of the people but also is insane even by his clown standards and doesn&#39;t know what&#39;s real. <br>Fascinating honestly

Nothing to do with the comics, cartoons, old movies. Nothing, nothing. The first movie could be just a random clown called Arthur Fleck and some other billionaire rather than Thomas Wayne, it would still be an awesome movie. Arthur could easily become the Travis Bickle of our time. But no, they&#39;re still trying to convince us that this is an alternative origin story for Joker. No, it&#39;s not."

But there is ONE actor I think can nail it. Stephen Merchant! He ticks EVERY BOX for the Joker, it&#39;s unreal. The tall and lanky frame. The face, and the charisma. And what Stephen nails to a T is the awkward sense of humor. If anyone watches his standups or his films, you&#39;ll know that he&#39;s very good at awkward comedy. So if James Gunn wants to get a 10/10 casting for the Joker in the Brave &amp; Bold movie, it&#39;s Stephen Merchant."

It&#39;s weird to say, but that one little turn kinda gave me chills."

@jaekim2554,2024-07-23T14:09:12Z,2024-07-23T14:09:12Z,0,"Love the acting, mood, visuals and everything but I absolutely hate the retarded version of the Joker. Fully understand how non-dc fans love this movie but really can&#39;t understand when dc fans love this movie. Joker is supposed to be conniving, sly, backstabbing, mad, and insane. So much so that it is impossible to predict his actions making him so hard to catch and only the absolute freaks are around him. But this version of Joker is just retarded and is strangely supported by the public - which is not something that would happen to Joker in DC comics since his insanity is beyond regular people&#39;s understanding. Moreover, I cannot imagine him tricking anyone with his low level of intelligence."

@samdouthitt5622,2024-07-23T14:03:24Z,2024-07-23T14:03:24Z,1,I don&#39;t have faith in sequels anymore. (I don&#39;t think anyone ever has) But the first Joker struck such a chord in my heart that I can only hope this isn&#39;t a dumb romance movie making Harley to be anything other a victim and/or accomplice. Impossible to say with knly two minutes but WB and Disney have been striking out lately

This portrayal is like he&#39;s the evil, anti-establishment messiah. You would just put him in solitary or have him executed - I am guessing they try both of these in the film and each time, the people save him, very anti-christ, he died for our sins but the Joker lives to make a mockery of virtue.<br><br>Mmm, there is probably a good film there, I just want to see his genius rather than fated happenstance but I can&#39;t because this incarnation of him is an idiot."

I suspect given they can&#39;t turn everyone brown like they normally do this is their attempt to spit in the audiences face and ritually humiliate the franchise for daring to have Margot Robbie as a crush.

But its not going to be grounded like the first one. I assume anytime he&#39;s in the paint and everything is over the top. He&#39;s clearly dreaming or fantasizing everything. I see too much jail images to think he&#39;s ever really causing chaos.

@rickfury1,2024-07-23T13:51:31Z,2024-07-23T13:51:31Z,0,"&quot;Folie à Deux&quot; is a French term that translates to &quot;madness of two.&quot; It refers to a psychiatric syndrome where delusional beliefs or hallucinations are transmitted from one individual to another. This condition usually involves two people who are closely related or have a close emotional connection, such as family members or romantic partners. The shared psychotic disorder can sometimes extend to more than two people, in which case it is referred to as folie à plusieurs (&quot;madness of many&quot;)."

@shaunbang,2024-07-23T13:43:34Z,2024-07-23T13:43:34Z,0,They should make the whole concept of things being in Joker’s head a way to get rid of his name being revealed as Arthur Fleck as it’s just not fitting for everyone to know who the Joker is. Would make way more sense if he made all of it up in his head and even he doesn’t know who he really is

Old School, Hangover are classics"

Excited for this no matter what, just know it’s gonna look amazing and have terrific performances. That’s enough for me to get into cinema to watch it"

Too much of a typical franchise sequel.

@DDR131,2024-07-23T13:10:46Z,2024-07-23T13:15:19Z,0,Joker 1 was one the most garbage movies I have seen but still better than Marvel movies. I still think Dune Part Two will be the best movie of the year and is probably of the decade. Blockbuster and independent combined. Generally I don&#39;t consider independent movies because those movies are usually much much better than Blockbuster movies.
