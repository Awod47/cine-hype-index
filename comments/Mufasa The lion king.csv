I mean for the bad things Scar was in the lion king, and he was cowardly you can say and manipulative, deceptive, vain but also Cunning. He was still also fearsome as a lion. So he had some strong characteristics not only this weak naive kid. And again the voice actor is not suitable at all for a grown scar character."

I have to say in the last 5 or so years with the woke storyline&#39;s, the choice of actors for these movies and not to mention the saturation of mediocre things like the marvel and star wars franchise I&#39;m sorry Disney but you lost that magic when you sold out to making money rather than when you made magic.."

@databaseadmin-mt9vf,2025-03-24T19:32:01Z,2025-03-24T19:32:01Z,0,"I think both mufaso and taka(scar) are both heirs to be king in their respective prides, but mufaso got lost as a kid and found scar&#39;s pride where he was adopted,  and then as adults both of them (now brothers) set out to find mufaso&#39;s original pride where mufaso is  rightfully king and scar being his brother was  going to be next until simba was born and  things changed. (Maybe for some reason scar could not go back to his original pride.)"

As far as plot goes was disapointed.  Overall the movie lacked the excitement, enthusiasm and magically feeling of lion kings before they changed to jon favreau and barry jenkins.  Go back to elton john and the original directors.  Get rid of Susan arnold and Bob Iger....Disney has been destroyed and fallen off a cliff with them."

The views of nature as they walk to the promised land are also beautiful. And I must admit that in this film, unlike the previous one, the facial expressions of the characters became more lively and natural, despite the hyperrealism."

Take was happy to have a brave brother but Sarabi divided them by choosing Mufasa despite Mufasa knows that Taka love her (Sarabi). 😣Had Taka has not lose the race deliberately in childhood, Mufasa may not have been alive and Mufasa became a king because of Sarabi motivated him by showing love &amp; care to Mufasa.

I don&#39;t really like realistic movies for animals that much but, I get that it&#39;s something new for newer generations. I find the story interesting but I still probably wouldn&#39;t watch it. If this movie was in animation rather than a more realistic version, I would watch it. There are a lot of things wrong with realistic animals over animation. The facial expressions, they are harder for the viewer to tell the emotions of animals."

Subjects aren&#39;t lit correctly, shadows aren&#39;t believable, the color grading is shallow and lacks any contrast, the fur rendering looks inconsistent and blurry, and when the fur is supposed to be wet, it looks completely dry.

@ivanka-vdR,2025-01-26T20:24:02Z,2025-01-26T20:24:02Z,0,"Why are people suddenly weirded out by Scar having a British accent? Takes it back to the roots of 1994, the actor back then was British too. I also think this definitely looks way more like the animated version with facial expressions and crazy scenes than the Lion King remake, like they decided to go somewhere in between. Looking kinda realistic but with the charm of the animated LK movies. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s any good though, haven&#39;t seen the movie but definitely will give it a shot. At least it&#39;s a new story, a prequel, instead of just another remake as they could have gone with LK Simba&#39;s Pride. But I&#39;m still convinced they should have casted all African voice actors. They should have already considered that in 1994."

I wonder if anyone else noticed the big mistake the author made with Scar&#39;s character. It seems that Scar was actually very kind as a child and loved Mufasa deeply. Even as they grew up, that love was still there. Yes, in a moment of anger, Scar felt hatred and wanted revenge out of jealousy, but he regretted it at the last moment and tried to protect Mufasa. This shows he had a good heart and didn&#39;t want to lose his brother. <br><br>Who among us is perfect? We all feel jealousy and anger sometimes, but the best of us are those who repent. Scar regretted his actions and wanted to save Mufasa! After that, Mufasa seemed to hate him so much that he couldn&#39;t even say Scar&#39;s name and made him feel like an outcast for life. Author, do you realize what you&#39;ve done? You&#39;ve made Mufasa appear cruel and spiteful when he was once seen as kind and caring. I really feel let down by this change."

Mufasa doesn’t matter. And Scars became a traitor against his will. But Mufasa forgive him. So sad story. And in the end Scars don’t saved Mufasas life 4th time. Thats all story.

Sad that the parents situation overshadowed the child’s moment to shine more. And the child doesn’t even look like she’s enjoying herself when she’s performing. Not a natural.

Taka, on the other hand, inherited his jealous nature from his own father, a lazy individual who failed to instill proper values in him. Despite this, Taka retained a spark of goodness, a legacy from his mother. Fate, however, intertwined their lives. Taka was destined to play a crucial role in saving Mufasa, who was born to be king.

@LGS27,2025-01-02T14:09:16Z,2025-01-02T14:09:16Z,2,"I continue to see posts and videos claiming that Mufasa ‘stole’ everything from Taka/ Scar and that Mufasa is the ‘true’ villain so I feel the need to clarify to people what the actual meaning of the story is and how it resembles the fact that no one is really a villain. Although i sympathise for Taka, love his story and understand his perspective it’s crucial to empathise that Mufasa never ‘took’ anything from him. It is also crucial to understand the circumstances that coerced Taka into becoming the character we know more closely as Scar.<br><br>First, the movie makes it clear that Taka held Mufasa’s life in his hands - and we all know that he ultimately ended it too. That was Taka’s destiny, his fate. But Mufasa did not take his mother, father (1), Sarabi (2) or the throne (3) from Taka nor did he betray Taka as suggested by Obasi, Taka’s father. <br><br>1. Taka’s parents differ significantly between the movie and the book. His mother, Eshe, is portrayed as kind, while his father, Obasi, is somewhat naive. Eshe saw something unique in Mufasa, potentially his greatness. Mufasa did not ask for her affection, nor force her to treat him as her own. Instead, Eshe became a source of comfort for Mufasa; there was no ‘stealing’ involved. Obasi, on the other hand, initially disliked Mufasa as he wasn’t a part of his bloodline or pride. Yet, this judgement shifts notably when Obasi displays genuine gratitude towards Mufasa for saving Eshe’s life during the white lion attack - something Mufasa did not have to do as after all he could have chosen to flee like Taka did. This clearly shows there was no ‘theft’ of Obasi’s loyalty from Taka, it was earned.<br><br>2. Regarding Sarabi, she had her eyes on Mufasa from the start - not Taka. Amongst great speculation that Sarabi has purposefully ‘led Taka on’, this idea is torn apart when it is confirmed that she had in fact dismissed feelings for Mufasa initially although being royalty herself like Taka. Mufasa had also dismissed his original feelings for Sarabi upon their first encounter as he was aware that Taka liked her, hinted at in Mufasa and Sarabi’s song ‘Tell me it’s you’ ;the lyrics being ‘I push you away, but the feelings come back just twice as strong.’ In the end, despite Mufasa’s attempts to aid Taka in winning Sarabi over while rejecting his own feelings, it was Mufasa who won her heart - especially after she gains the knowledge that it was him who saved her during the elephant stampede, and was also him who had recognised the scent of the flowers from on her fur from the valley using his skills taught by Eshe. Yes, it is implied that Taka ‘loved’ Sarabi, but destiny had already determined that Mufasa and Sarabi were meant to be together. There was never a relationship between Sarabi and Taka, as even Rafiki alluded to when describing Taka’s emotional struggles. <br><br>3. Finally, the throne and Milele. Previous to Mufasa, there were no kings who had ruled this land, nor were there any lions. They were orphan due to Mufasa’s purity and bravery. He became the first king of Milele and ultimately the greatest Lion King. It is never implied that Taka’s destiny was to be king of Milele, simply that he were to be king of some pride at the eventual time."

I couldn’t stomach the 2019 version and Scar was the worst part of it (apart from the new Timon 🤮🤮🤮), he just had no charisma. To make his resentment justified? What’s the point?

@jordan1650,2024-12-30T22:58:24Z,2024-12-30T22:58:24Z,0,"One of this movie&#39;s biggest mistakes was making Mufasa be adopted into the royal lion family, instead of both Mufasa and Scar being birth siblings because that honestly makes Scar&#39;s hatred and jealousy towards Mufasa look justified, which is completely backwards. Scar&#39;s hatred towards Mufasa is supposed to be unjustified and not to be sympathized with, but instead they just had Mufasa and the other characters unfairly take Scar&#39;s kingly position from him, which makes Scar look like the victim. Mufasa&#39;s kingly position in the 1994 movie was justified, while this movie made his position look corrupted. Or... if Disney really insists on changing Mufasa&#39;s and Scar&#39;s backstory around by having one of the brothers be adopted into the royal lion family to explain why their appearances are very different, then it should&#39;ve been Scar. That would be at least be fitting for Scar&#39;s villainous character, since Scar would start off being very grateful and loving towards his brother Mufasa after getting adopted, but overtime he starts to get jealous over how much everyone respects Mufasa more than him, how Sarabi is attracted to Mufasa more than him, how Mufasa is often stronger and better than him in different ways, and that Mufasa is going to be the future king when Scar would rather be the king. Then that would all at least work for Scar&#39;s future villainous character."

And one thing I will say is I felt really bad for scar, in the original movie he’s depicted as this soulless killer who wanted his place as king but it’s sad because he saved mufasa’s life twice and what he got for it in return was his dad choosing mufasa over him, he trusted Mufasa with letting him know he loved the girl lion (I forget the name sometimes sorry) then he loses the girl who was supposed to be his queen to his brother after mufasa knew he had feelings for her, then he loses his right as king after being told he’d be king his whole life, but at the same time it’s not mufasa’s fault she fell in love with him bc his bravery that saved her, it’s just the point he knew he liked her you know? And with her saying scar was just born to protect mufasa, that was the birth of the villian. And I understand both sides way more now."

@amarvelousstory1829,2024-12-29T13:26:16Z,2024-12-29T13:43:28Z,0,"Spoiler alert:<br>Sarabi was maybe the main reason of Scar&#39;s resentment towards Mufasa. Tika later known as Scar in the prequel was deeply hurt. He was really into Sarabi but she chose Mufasa yet Scar had has his chance with her but didn&#39;t know how to handle his feelings and everything that was happening. He tried to be courageous by saving his adoptive brother when there was the flood but didn&#39;t feel enough though. On top  of that Mufasa was the one who saved Sarabi from a dangerous wound and he gave credential to Scar instead . Then Mufasa and Sarabi flirted ,Scar wasn&#39;t deprived of courage but it was an internal conflict between who he was and his close relationship with Mufasa (who is older) and who always took high responsibilities . He felt robbed when Sarabi chose him because everything Mufasa had he wanted too and could have if less into himself . So for me it was a love-hate Brotherhood story."

@SHARIAN5,2024-12-26T15:25:04Z,2024-12-26T15:25:04Z,0,"Mufasa was the firstborn son of Ahadi and Uru, and the eldest brother of Prince Taka. During his childhood, Ahadi would often sit with Mufasa during the night, and told him the stories about the stars. Upon approaching adulthood, Mufasa would be declared king by his father, leaving Taka jealous. Taka made friends with Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed, hyenas who lived in the elephant graveyard and resented Ahadi. The hyenas plotted with Taka to find a means of humiliating Mufasa to devalue his credibility as future king. To accomplish this, Taka staged a buffalo attack, but the plan backfired and the raging buffalo instead injured Taka, giving him his infamous scar. A little while later, a red-billed hornbill named Zazu was almost getting cooked alive by the hyenas until Mufasa frightens them off making Zazu thankful and hopes he can be of service to the future king, which he doubts, Zazu eventually follows him around making the future king tired, Zazu disturbs his hunt and his primate time with his future mate Sarabi. One day, Zazu notices some vultures hovering and he asks Mufasa if he wants to fly over and see what&#39;s happening, but he is not concerned and decides to nap instead, but he later tells Mufasa that Sarabi is stuck in a pit and can&#39;t get out, but Zazu finds a tree trunk, which ultimately saves Sarabi, and Mufasa realizes that Zazu is useful around and he points him as a royal advisor, after his father&#39;s death he becomes the new king of Pride Rock, shortly thereafter he had a son named Simba which causes Scar to become even more jealous knowing that his nephew will inherit the throne someday and he couldn’t.<br><br>They made the villain a hero and hero a villain"

In the original Lion King, <b>Scar and Mufasa are brothers by blood</b> .<br>The producer of The Lion King said it himself that they are related, not to mention the story was inspired by Hamlet, which is about biological brothers.<br>Besides that, in the original story, they call each other brothers. If they weren’t blood-related, It would have likely been brought up at some point."

The character designs would&#39;ve looked more distinct in the og animation. Here every lion just looks like the same lion. If not for the voices you can barely tell them apart by coloring and facial markings. As a kid I definitely wouldn&#39;t be able to.

@juancruz-jg5pq,2024-12-21T14:25:26Z,2024-12-21T14:25:26Z,1,"Mufasa: The Lion King review: &#39;Pointless&#39; and a &#39;contrived cash-in&#39;.<br><br>This prequel to a re-make &quot;never picks up momentum&quot; – &quot;Don&#39;t the talented artists involved have anything better to do with their time?&quot;<br><br>When the CEO of Disney announced in February that the studio would start relying more on &quot;sequels and franchises&quot;, he wasn&#39;t joking. Already this year, we&#39;ve had Inside Out 2 and Moana 2, and now we have Mufasa: The Lion King, a prequel to 2019&#39;s photorealistic remake of 1994&#39;s much-loved cartoon.<br><br>Yes, we&#39;re talking about a prequel to a remake. And, yes, it&#39;s as pointless as that description makes it sound. This contrived cash-in may be worth sitting through on Disney+ if you&#39;re a Lion King superfan, but, like so many prequels, it devotes tremendous amounts of thought and energy to answering questions that nobody was asking in the first place. When did Simba&#39;s dad Mufasa meet his wife Sarabi? Where did Rafiki the mandrill get his walking stick? How did Zazu the hornbill become Mufasa&#39;s right-hand man (or, I suppose, right-paw bird)? The film is directed by Barry Jenkins, who made the Oscar-winning Moonlight, and the songs are by Lin-Manuel Miranda, the most feted Hollywood and Broadway songwriter of his generation, so a more pressing question might be: don&#39;t the supremely talented artists involved have anything better to do with their time?<br>The big question the film answers, however, is how a lowly lion named Mufasa (Aaron Pierre) found his way to the idyllic Pride Lands with a friend who would become known as Scar (Kelvin Harrison Jr) – and I can guarantee that nobody had been asking that question, because it contradicts everything that was established in The Lion King. If you remember, the whole point of the original film was that Mufasa&#39;s son Simba was the latest in a long line of monarchs who had protected the Pride Lands for generations, and that Mufasa&#39;s younger brother Scar was annoyed about his place in the pecking order. But presumably somebody at Disney became uncomfortable with that feudal premise, so they&#39;ve scrapped it in favour of a more complicated and egalitarian origin story. The trouble is that this democratic new version fits the lore so badly that the producers might as well have renamed their film Mufasa: The Lion Prime Minister. It&#39;s as bad as Padmé being &quot;elected&quot; as the queen of her planet when she was a 14-year-old girl in Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace.<br><br>Anyway, the film opens with the news that Simba (Donald Glover) and his wife Nala (Beyoncé) are about to have another cub, so they disappear into a forest without telling their daughter Kiara (Blue Ivy Carter) where they&#39;re going or why. (The motivation behind this bizarrely bad bit of parenting is never explained.) Kiara&#39;s babysitters are Timon the meerkat (Billy Eichner) and Pumbaa the warthog (Seth Rogen), and together they sit in a cave while Rafiki (John Kani) tells her about her grandfather Mufasa. After this unnecessarily long and complicated set-up, the main plot gets underway. (Spoiler ahead)<br><br>The film is all about lions talking to other lions while being pursued by yet more lions, so it can be visually monotonous – it can also be challenging to keep track of which lion is which"

@DragonFire_96,2024-12-19T02:04:03Z,2024-12-19T02:04:03Z,0,Hold on I thought that scar and Mufasa were from the same litter? like how could you change what was said in the literal original movie like that movie is a classic so like what gives <br><br>(Also before anyone goes to the replies yes I did notice that they gave a tiny bit of realism to the movie only difference while um if there was an actual pride of fully white lions they wouldn’t last long in the wild they’d be hunted so freaking fast like I am not joking about that pride would be gone either to be kept in a sanctuary where they would be protected from poulterers or well I think you all know the other very sad truth)

@BudJr,2024-12-13T11:19:27Z,2024-12-13T11:19:27Z,0,"The first one only made a billion bucks because of nostalgia, and because they got the biggest stars on the planet to voice the characters. So they didn’t need to give the animals facial expressions to add real emotion to the film. They didn’t have to give any respect to “Be Prepared”, one of the greatest villain songs of all time. They had no problem with the characters singing “Can You Feel The Love Tonight” during the DAY. They had no problem with making Scar so obviously mentally disturbed that he wouldn’t be able fool anybody into doing anything. <br><br>“Yes, the past can hurt. But you can either learn from it, or run from it.” In the original version, Rafiki told this to Simba. It was one of the most important lessons in the film, and they completely skipped over it because baboons don’t hold sticks in real life. But for some reason Rafiki was allowed to have his stick in the fight scene at the end. <br><br>The hill Mufasa was on wasn’t even close to being steep enough for him to fall off of it, but for some reason he acted like he couldn’t climb it. In the remake, Mufasas death was his fault. There’s no reason that he shouldn’t have been able to climb that hill. And Mufasa should’ve realized that in this version, Scar was clearly evil. Scar didn’t try at any point in the new version to act innocent. If Mufasa realized it, he would’ve never ended up in this situation in the first place. <br><br>This new movie doesn’t have nostalgia to lean on as a crutch. They’re telling a new story. They will have to put in some actual effort. The characters will have to actually emote. The villain will have to be more sophisticated, not just pure evil. If they want this movie to perform as well as the first one, they have to make a whole lot of changes. This trailer looks exactly the same as the first one. So I’m predicting this movie isn’t going to perform well at all."

I was confused, like what…I didn’t know that was really his actual name until I looked it up on google.  I was like whoa 😮.  <br>And when I first saw the trailer, I was so excited, and I was so amazed by the characters, and their origin stories being told, to us as the audience.  <br>I have always wondered how Mufasa, and Scar (Taka) became brothers???  And I told my brother one day, I told him, I said “They, should make a Disney movie, about how Mufusa, and Scar (Taka) become brothers in the first place together.  <br>And after years and years. We finally, get a Disney movie about Mufusa and Scar(Taka) becoming brothers and being brothers together."

@adamcheck4941,2024-11-27T20:51:21Z,2024-11-27T21:14:43Z,0,The way Disney is making this movie ultra realistic just like the ill revived lion king 2019 instead of going back to 2d animation like the popular1994 version is more evidence Disney just messes up success of their own stuff  these days just  as they did with George Lucas&#39;s stuff with star wars and Indiana Jones. They  can&#39;t admit when they&#39;ve made a mistake and change.

@teriosthehedgehogsa2artist849,2024-11-26T02:02:04Z,2024-11-26T02:04:04Z,1,Disney can say how hard they worked on this soulless cash-grab to a beloved animated movie classic of the 1990s. But we all know that this quote-on-quote &quot;live-action&quot; prequel was made out of corporate greed and heartless exploitation that uses nostalgia baiting to fool viewers into watching a mediocre movie. This film will likely flop as hard as Mufasa falling off the cliff in the original Lion King   walt disney would be ashamed of you

@HalonElsa-MusicandStories,2024-11-21T10:01:02Z,2024-11-21T10:01:02Z,0,"<b>Mufasa: The Lion King</b> is an upcoming prequel to *The Lion King*, set to release on December 20, 2024. Directed by Barry Jenkins, the film will delve into the backstory of Mufasa, the iconic lion king. The movie will explore his rise to power, his relationship with his brother Taka (who later becomes the villain Scar), and how he became the beloved leader of the Pride Lands.<br><br>The story will be told through flashbacks, with Rafiki narrating the legend to Kiara, Simba and Nala’s daughter. This film will blend live-action and photoreal CGI, similar to the 2019 *The Lion King*. The cast includes Aaron Pierre as Mufasa, Kelvin Harrison Jr. as Scar, and Tiffany Boone as Sarabi, among others. Also, music will be provided by Lin-Manuel Miranda, known for his work on *Hamilton*. <br><br>Make sure to mark your calendar for its theatrical release in December 2024!"

The Lion King is based off Tanzanian culture. If they made a movie about pandas and kangaroos. They&#39;ll make it known that this is Chinese and Australian culture. African culture doesn&#39;t even get mentioned in this. Where do you think the Lion King takes place at?

(2) When it comes to brute strength I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m on the shallow end of the &quot;Gene&quot; pool. Additionally Zazu mentions after that - &quot;There&#39;s always one in the family sire! Two in my case actually&quot;. I do understand that I may be overthinking but under normal conversational circumstances &quot;Gene&quot; and &quot;Older brother&quot; were a bit more familial kind of words used? He could have just mentioned it as &quot;Beloved brother / I&#39;m not the stronger one&quot; if the adopted line was going to be taken. Don&#39;t know"

@Filius_Solis_777,2024-10-09T13:50:34Z,2024-10-09T13:50:34Z,0,"According to the millennia-old tradition of the divine right of kings, a legitimate ruler who acts in accordance with the will of God through virtue and true justice bestows the gifts of prosperity and peace upon society. Under his righteous government, stability and economic well-being flourish, and social order is assured. However, when the throne is occupied by an usurper, a tyrant, or a ruler without legitimacy, the fabric of civilization disintegrates, giving way to chaos, decline, and the scourges of crises, crime, famine, plagues, and wars. The morality and legitimacy of the ruler are the pillars of stability; their absence plunges society into the abyss of disorder. This tradition imposes a double burden on the monarch: his responsibility is not only toward men but also toward God. He must govern with wisdom and fairness, for divine displeasure can be as relentless as that of the people. The fate of a nation is therefore closely tied to the character of its ruler. A king’s inability to maintain the favor and trust of his subjects makes his reign unsustainable, dragging him into an inexorable cycle of crises and suffering. To preserve his legitimacy, it is imperative that the ruler aligns his actions with the sublime values expected by both the deity and the community. This tradition does not merely justify royal authority but elevates royal power to an ethical dimension, where the nation’s prosperity depends on the virtuous behavior of the ruler. Social harmony thus arises from this intimate relationship between ruler and subjects, in which royal justice and morality are regarded as indispensable foundations for collective well-being."

@plumfairy-eb3kp,2024-09-30T10:09:01Z,2024-09-30T10:17:26Z,0,The plot is very confusing.🤣🤔 I don&#39;t think I will go see this one. 2018 Kiara was already very confusing and made a mess for Leos. I think Disney should just give up on the story of Lion King and focus on Mickey Mouse and Minnie. I was working at local government sponsored thrifty store and there was this Simba statue totally cursed by its owner with scary engravings inside.

@ShadowOnTheWall666,2024-09-29T04:29:27Z,2024-09-29T04:37:54Z,0,"I am disappointed that this is in the live CGI universe and not the OG and uses the birth name for Scar in the non-canon Six New Adventures, Taka meaning &#39;waste&#39; or &#39;trash&#39; which fits better in that universe where he was the rejected second son. Considering how this concept clashes with The Lion Guard, I am going to assume the live CGI universe is an alternate TLK. <br>Furthermore, I agree with what others have said about the voices, those voices just don&#39;t fit the characters. <br><br>The first live CGI seemed to focus its cast on African voice actors, no doubt for authenticity as was done with Harry Potter with the exception of Timon and Pumbaa, hence James Earl Jones being the only OG asked to return. (R.I.P. I honestly wondered if that dude might live forever). What happened to that? <br><br>Granted as an OG fan since its 1994 release, I never could fully accept a Scar without Jeremey Irons&#39; voice so perhaps I am being a bit biased. <br><br>I do, however, appreciate the concept that Scar was the rightful heir and lost it to a brother who wasn&#39;t even blood related to him. It gives him more depth and ties more appropriately into the line &quot;when at last I am given my dues&quot; in Scar&#39;s villain song &#39;Be Prepared&#39;."

@jimmyleejackson4020,2024-09-24T07:29:32Z,2024-09-24T07:29:32Z,1,I&#39;m mad I didn&#39;t hate that 😂. Like I&#39;m kinda into it and I wish I wasn&#39;t. But the death if James Earl Jones really got me feeling nostalgic and I can&#39;t wait to see what this story is. It&#39;s new and to be fair to Disney even thoe it&#39;s easy it&#39;s still sum new which is exactly what we&#39;ve all been asking for. We&#39;ve never thought about the history of Mufasa and scar too much and now we&#39;re all realizing how insane that could actually be. Especially if Scar was the one to save Mufasa when they first met only to betray him at his end. A tragic end that was definitely in need of a grand history. I can&#39;t wait to see this. This is the first Disney story ive been excited about in a very long time. I pray it&#39;s good. Please be good.

He was the younger brother and his family hated him. Saw him as useless. Which is what led to him becoming evil. <br><br><br>Plus Mufasa was a spoiled brat. In the Lion Guard the story was more interesting. His name was Askari (Soldier) and since he would never see the throne, his parents had him trained to be a military leader instead. He even gained the roar of the Elders. The reason he became scar is because he stopped an evil Lion and his Serpent side kick from overthrowing the royal family. <br><br>The serpent gave him that scar and the venom that flowed through his veins was magical. It made him evil. If his family had tried to cure him he would probably never have become evil. But even Mufasa brushed it off. In fact he was the one who named him Scar to mock him. <br><br><br>And the rest of the Lion Guard started to call him that too. Which led to him killing them all with the Roar of the Elders. And lost his power when he did that. And ended up being partially banished into the Hyena&#39;s territory."

@qriusjorj38,2024-09-19T06:14:07Z,2024-09-19T06:18:23Z,1,"Hi Disney. I can guarantee that putting short content, like trailers and updates for released content akin to the one for Deadpool &amp; Wolverine, behind an adwall to already paying Disney+ subscribers will have way more detrimental effects to your pocketbooks in the long term than your advisors are telling you. They&#39;re only looking in their own short term interests and banking on the relatively miniscule returns based solely on this tiny boost to ad revenue. Your loss in brand confidence, subscriber base, and long term losses in revenue at your theme parks will far outweigh any short term benefits from this ad revenue. We have already swallowed the bitter pill of ads in movies and shows that we&#39;ve already paid for; adding very short term content to this will alienate many more patrons than you think. You may look at it as ad revenue per minute of content but we see it as advertisement time per minute of (already paid for) content, and the numbers are really grim.

Who jumped in to save them? Mufasa!... remember when Simba challenged Scar to battle, he cheated and gained the upperhand by throwing fire and ash in his face... even blamed the Hyenas when Simba ran down on him and said they were the real enemy....a real KING stands up and accepts ANY challenge in the pride.... that&#39;s just my theory on this storyline cuz I couldn&#39;t figure out if Scar was the rightful King, why&#39;d he get overlooked and watching this and going back to the movie....I can see why...."

(like in real life, the frailer looking one (like Scar) is usually not the head of the pack) <br><br>I don&#39;t like it. I used to think in my head as a kid that Mufasa was the more liked of the two and that their father abused Scar verbally and physically and was only loved by their mother and Mufasa never noticed the abuse and was too caught up in being &quot;awesome&quot;. I like my head cannon movie better lol still makes you feel bad for Scar but it makes sense and can still get behind that he becomes a cowardly villain"

( Not fully grown lion) The two went on hunting like kiara did (simba daughter) but mufasa wanted follow the voices on his head and the familiar smell to go back to the kingdom where he belong . Taka(scar) accompanied him because they are brothers. Upon adventure the two meets ZAZU,RAFIKI,SARABI. Mufasa and taka challenge the white lion and win the battle. The brothers take back the kingdom of pride rock and mufasa became a king. The two was live happy UNTIL. Taka(scar) was next in line to became a king after mufasa but the hairball was born (SIMBA) . Taka became MAD and jealous that&#39;s why he tried to kill his nephew. The rest is on the lion king 1( 1995)<br><br>Simplest summary. Thank you!"

@reyveronasworld,2024-09-03T19:55:24Z,2024-09-03T19:55:24Z,1,I think that the reason Scar was denied the throne was because Rafiki sensed the evil and darkness deep inside him and the villain Scar would grow up to be. Like how Oogway sensed the evil in Tai Lung in Kung Fu Panda.

You can never actually guess the entire movie storyline through a 2 minute trailer cut. Maybe we should judge the movie when we see it completely. Tbh its a movie, I understand we all grew up watching this - I myself am a major Lion King fan, but it is entertainment and should not be judged at face value even before you see it. No use in feeling bad for a movie when you see it at home and realise it was actually good! Anyways, looking forward to seeing this."

@n0ta_cat797,2024-08-31T02:45:36Z,2024-08-31T03:01:06Z,1,"Im gonna be completely honest in my opinion. For me at least, this trailer looks a lot better then the first one. It more paints an idea of the story they want to tell. It does make a few slight changes from tje original origin story so it seems there telling it in a slightly different way. This story has also never been told in a movie like this. Im still not entirely convinced on the cgi i wish they went with a style somewhat like 2d animated characters in a live action world or just made them look more like cartoon characters. I know a lot of people are saying that this movie is gonna get destroyed in the box office by sonic but im not entirely convinced. Despite all the criticism that the 2019 live action adaptation got it still mad over $1 Billion in the global box office. I feel like this movie will still do well with younger demographics especially since in European territories sonic doesn&#39;t release until December 26th. Also i feel like sonic has always more been targeted towards teenagers and most smaller kids wouldn&#39;t be interested in seeing it. Despite this i still think both movies will do well in the box office"

Mufasa must have gotten separated at a young age or hit his head, so he has little to no memory of where he came from. If anything, he&#39;s always been the rightful prince of pride rock. <br><br>2)Taka/Scar&#39;s pride doesn&#39;t look like they are even in pride rock, so that makes Taka a prince to a different pride.<br><br>So, I think as the two journey as young adults, Mufasa learns of his origin, and travels to pride Rock, where he&#39;s given back his title as King of Pride Rock. Meanwhile, Taka, who was a prince of a different Pride, lost his pride to the white Lion and slowly loses everything. So, while Mufasa keeps gaining, Taka is slowly losing, becoming more envious and Jealous of the Lion he saved. Thus, why he feels he deserves the place as king, for if it wasn&#39;t for him, Mufasa wouldn&#39;t even be alive (Ironic I know). Then the two fight, Mufasa give scar the scar, and thus bringing us to where the other &quot;live action&quot; takes place. <br><br>Now maybe Mufasa also steals the lioness scar had a crush on, Sarabi, which doesn&#39;t help. But that&#39;s my idea of what may happen. Could be wrong, but only time will tell once the movie comes out. :)"

I know Disney loves their CGI and live actions but it would feel more connected to the first movie, allow more vivid scenery, more emotion displayed on the lions, and even have scenes from Simba carry to Mufasa with his own twist as a little father like son thing. The story seems really solid and cool so far, luv the detail about adopted brother as it paints Scar and Mufasa’s relationship in a whole new light but I’ll forever miss the old Disney animations ❤"

This is most likely a very unpopular opinion, but I actually loved the 2019 remake of &#39;The Lion King&#39;. I&#39;d even go as far as to say it&#39;s better than the original; though the original will always hold a very special place in my heart as my favorite movie. This is only the first trailer, but so far it looks promising; the animation especially looks excellent. I&#39;m staying cautiously optimistic, obviously, but I&#39;m very curious to see where this goes and can&#39;t wait to see it. I just pray this movie does good, that&#39;s all I want. That and more Lion King movies, namely a remake of &#39;The Lion King 2&#39;. Most likely not gonna happen, but guy can dream."

@Fansrai,2024-08-24T16:53:36Z,2024-08-24T16:55:02Z,1,"I like the trailer and im excited like a lot of people, but ngl a story more based on Taka like mainly focusing on him would’ve been better. I mean I’m a Taka/Scar fan for life, and y’know not to upset Mufasa fans but I kinda see why he killed him. Imagine having your birthright taken away from you from an orphan you picked up, you considered him your brother before he technically took everything from you. I saw comments saying “well Mufasa deserved to be king” and “the pride lands looked bad after Scar took rule”. But ima be so for real it probably would have been how his(Taka’s) father lead if Taka became the king he was meant to be, since he doesn’t seem bad at all. Like he’s a gentle giant type of lion, it’s just technically Mufasa taking his rightful place messed my boy up bad, especially if he was like Simba waiting to be king kind of his whole life."

@henriettaabeyta1457,2024-08-22T04:11:10Z,2024-08-22T04:15:37Z,0,"Careful Disney you&#39;ve created a motion picture that saddened some of your fans quite quick with this trailer. And you&#39;ve made these lions look rougher than the real ones letting them seem like restless wrestlers, Scar&#39;s now worse than Steele in Balto&#39;s first film. And Mufasa&#39;s not what he used to be in this type of movie, he doesn&#39;t look calm and tolerant, he looks playful. Orphan scenes is like throwing away the family tree secrets online and in  a few of the picture books these brothers already have. It&#39;s the bat eared fox I wish you didn&#39;t subtract from the animated film myself. I don&#39;t like how rough the Lion Guard treats the circle of life either, Simba treats others as if he doesn&#39;t care about balance of life, but cares too much about safety."
