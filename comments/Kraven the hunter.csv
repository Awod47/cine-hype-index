Dissapointing and mediocre, with a p*ss-poor dialogue. Some might like it. I was hoping for something a little darker."

Movies should not change the narratives, character dynamics, or how characters acquire their powers. This is partly why DC has been performing better; they stick closely to the comic scripts.

The actors delivered performances so raw and electrifying that they felt almost otherworldly capturing the essence of their characters with an intensity that leaves you speechless. The stunts are nothing short of jaw-dropping, a perfect symphony of danger and precision, executed with such finesse that they redefine the standard for action choreography. Every fight sequence is an adrenaline-fueled masterpiece, blending art and chaos seamlessly. The commitment and passion poured into this film by the entire cast and crew are evident in every frame. Truly, Kraven the Hunter sets a new bar for action films, leaving an unforgettable mark on the genre."

@ggddxssdancexp,2024-12-27T08:33:45Z,2024-12-27T08:33:45Z,1,I loved this movie 🍿 never saw the trailer until now. I heard it was Marvel so I expected a lot of fight scenes. This movie is not like a typical marvel movie (which I love)  Kraven feels like a mythological story alive in the theater. Truly a movie to marvel at. Kraven isn’t even on the screen too much and I actually found myself wanting more Kraven. It’s an interesting adventure 🦁

Overall, I do like the movie (though most people seem to hate it) but it tried to do too much at once.<br><br>I believe (and that&#39;s just my opinion, do with it what you will) that the movie would&#39;ve worked so much better if it just focused on either how Kraven became The Hunter OR about the conflict with Rhino. Whatever was left out could&#39;ve become part two or an eventual Origins prequel. The directors and script writers could&#39;ve fleshed out the conflicts much more and draw at the emotions of the audience"

@thisismyactualyoutubehandle,2024-12-21T21:52:48Z,2024-12-21T21:53:23Z,0,"This movie was good. As far as trailer vs movie... movie didn&#39;t use ANY Johnny Cash music--dumb. Also, that full-on vest he wears? Only gets it at end of movie so obviously no scenes in jungle wearing it like in this trailer.<br><br>Point being: this movie was good... far and away better than both Mobius and Madame Web. It is unfortunate that it&#39;s on the Sony branch of Marvel though... one and done.<br><br>Bonus: Ariana DeBose is amazing. If a new Catwoman on DC side? She should be it. That is all."

I think disney is ruining the marvel brand but that&#39;s just my opinion. the movie was ok I definitely wouldn&#39;t pay to see it in a theater.

@BehdisZandieh,2024-12-17T14:49:52Z,2024-12-17T14:49:52Z,0,"“Kraven the Hunter delivers a gritty and intense take on one of Spider-Man’s most iconic foes. With a focus on raw action and character exploration, the film dives deep into Kraven’s complex psyche and primal instincts. The performances are strong, especially in portraying Kraven’s transformation into a relentless predator, while the cinematography enhances the dark and visceral tone. While it may not break new ground in the genre, it offers an entertaining and ferocious look at a morally gray antihero. Fans of darker comic adaptations will find much to appreciate.”"

It&#39;s got a lot of setup and is plot heavy at times, but the acting is all there given the script, which isn&#39;t bad to be as fair as possible. Go check this out, it&#39;s thoroughly enjoyable and supercedes Morbius in many aspects and is a massive improvement on Venom 2. The cinematography is another plus, really well shot scenes. Five to eight years ago this would have been praised, only now are fans and critics difficult to please. The actors and directors placed a lot of effort into this, it was cut post production and a handful of scenes were removed to shorten the runtime. Don’t pass on this movie, it&#39;s tailored perfectly for the big screen."

You can be a proud hunter and have respect for the animal kingdom all the same. Sure, its alittle morally grey but that is Kraven. In the comics he has tended to and protected a animal. In fact he&#39;s utterly horrified seeing a hornless rhino nearlly killed by poachers.<br><br>All in all while he respects animals and loves them in a twisted way, he still wants to be the apex predator in both food chains so i hope they can find that balance."

@johnkyl123,2024-08-24T14:57:42Z,2024-08-24T14:57:42Z,0,"Here’s what we know so far: <br><br>- Kraven gets his powers by hunting a lion in his usual fashion, it scratches him and the lion’s blood enters his scratch wound. So as of right now, his powers are gifted by nature in the supernatural sense. Blood meeting blood.<br><br>- His powers include animal-like strength, animal-like speed, animal-like ability to climb, ability to view the world through any animal in his aoe’s eyes and to also control/make predator animals obey as the Alpha of any pack mentality would. He only has normal durability in this verse as he is seen hiding/under stress while needing to dodge gunfire. <br><br>- Rich philanthropist is also experimenting with human/animal hybridization after knowledge of the lizard/symbiotes/morbius hits the streets. His team of researchers in the samedi, kill kraven’s mother and father. <br><br>- Kraven sets on a revenge mission, only for the man to have successfully completed this process; albeit it makes the user more of an animal/less human depending on dosage. The antagonist/final battle is rhino, with Kraven afterwards setting his sights on his classic wording “abominations of nature.” <br><br>- Kraven will more than likely travel directly to New York after the events, as Sony has confirmed that every movie after venom is a bridge-point for their Sony verse at large. <br><br>- Sony has given confirmation through every movie installed thus far, that every member of the six and numerous side villains now reside in New York (Whether they’ve been shown yet or not). Aside of Hardy’s venom as well. And in the end of venom 2, we get confirmation that spiderman is present within the Sony verse, he just hasn’t been shown directly. So Kraven is now added fully to this select as well. <br><br>- The scale of this spider-man will have to be phenomenal as it seems they’re going for a Sinister Six/Kill Peter Parker mashup. And lastly, they’ve already lowkey collaborated with marvel, as we wouldn’t have got the venom 2 ending scene which technically already paired the verses through multiverse. This may very well be the project that involves all 3 spiderman as it would only be fitting to face that many villains within a movie setting."

This could have been a cool idea for a film, and it just looks like cringe level drivel.

He’s a skilled martial artist, he’s a solid actor, he’s a stunt man, and importantly he has the size! Kraven isnt a guy whos in shape. He’s jacked, he’s bigger and stronger, he’s not some guy that just works out. ATJ is in shape, but his bones literally are too small for the role. Kraven has more muscle, he’s sizable and intimidating when he walks in."

Nothing better. <br>Trying to turn all villains into his guts is the most pathetic thing that comic books and their associated media have done.<br>The only one that&#39;s ever worked for me is Maleficent (Disney, not comics, I know) because she WAS persecuted for being different and a monster. Monsters aren&#39;t always villains, it&#39;s normal humans who make them that way."

And after seeing that trailer, no doubt that it will continue for a few more years. How can they constantly create the worst Marvel content possible? The Amazing Spiderman 2, Madame Webb, Morbius, Venom (which had a massive potential and was impossible to fail if they had done Rated -R movies, but they found ways to even fail those movies) and now &quot;Kraven&quot;. The worst of the worst marvel movies. Even The Marvels is better than anything Sony Marvel has produced since 20 years. Only the 2 spider-verse movies were good."

You can&#39;t tell me that there aren&#39;t other fresh, up and coming or established talented actors that could have played this role? 🤷🏽‍♂️ (it was even kind of disappointing seeing Russell Crowe being recycled into another MCU film/character when we just saw him in Thor Love &amp; Thunder?) Where is the next generation of physical new, young, breakout action stars that can carry a major film ??! ! (Should we be maybe checking out goofy coming of age dramatic Netflix or Amazon comedies ala modern-day versions of Risky Business to find the next Tom Cruise? Can we find the next young, smart mouthed reluctant action hero like Bruce Willis? Is there a young underdog character that we can root that can do what Stallone did for Rocky I,II &amp; III? Will we ever give young Wesley Snipes (Blade) and young Michael Jai White (Spawn) the credit they deserve for keeping the live action comicbook based film industry alive during the 90s before 20th Century Fox&#39;s first attempt at MCU  arrived with their Spider-Man, mediocre Fantastic Four or X-Men films?"

@BoneHeadsParanormal,2024-08-15T05:43:23Z,2024-08-15T05:43:23Z,41,"The only thing that actually brings this movie down is that it&#39;s supposed to be Kraven, if this was a non Marvel project where a morally ambiguous man who was raised by a crime boss who hunted for sport became a sort of hired gun that goes after bad guys, who eventually run into villains who use genetics to modify they&#39;re physical form into hybrids, it would be pretty good. But this is sadly Kraven the Hunter and that&#39;s just dumb because Kraven&#39;s a villain and not a hero. But I&#39;ll hold onto hope that maybe this surprises me and after some time is looked fondly on and becomes a hidden gem in Sony&#39;s villain verse."

Kraven isn&#39;t even worth keeping as a character. Here&#39;s why Kraven will fail and get review bombed EVEN on streaming platforms. <br><br>Has absolutely zero powers, none. Nothing at all.<br> His gimmik is that he&#39;s a animal poacher. <br>A rated R villain will NEVER work with spiderman, maybe spiderman noir though. Maybe. <br>This films looks like a psycho child directed it. <br>They wasted the genetic rhino on this character no one actually likes when he should have been reserved for spiderman noir. <br><br>I look forward to sony learning their lesson from this trash. Any success is going to be a lie.<br><br>Examples of horrible movies &quot;being successful&quot; are the worst batman movie ever made with a extremely unrealistic year 2 batman  &quot;the batman&quot; whose villain wore a extremely offensive gimp suit. <br>Another example is &quot;the joker&quot; which depicted a random criminal convicted for hurting kids in &quot;that horrible unspeakable way&quot; <br>Then you have most horror movies, like saw, which realistically wouldn&#39;t ever gave been allowed in theaters or had success ever."

Venom is enjoyable if you give yourself amnesia from the comics storyline and embrace it as something different I guess.

Feels like they gave the trailer editor 2 assignments<br>&quot;Make sure people know it&#39;s R-RATED and that he&#39;s a HUNTER!!, in fact try and put as much of the word hunter in there as you can!!&quot; I love the part when the Rhino got his powers from a drop of Rhinoceros blood and learned &quot;with great horns, comes great horniness&quot;"

@MarvGlenks64629,2024-08-15T00:01:14Z,2024-08-15T00:01:14Z,0,The problem is they keep making villain movies without spider man so they try to make them heroes instead of true villains
