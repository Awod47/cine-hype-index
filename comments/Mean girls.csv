@margrett-jasmynstevens6872,2024-05-09T14:08:12Z,2024-05-09T14:08:12Z,0,The one thing that I think it would have been better for this. The movie is if instead of redoing the old one. All over again. They shouldn&#39;t done it like all of these guys. So all the guys are running the first movie. They all graduated the new plastics come in and they have to show back up to give them like advice to sell kind of like glee when the alumni come back after they shouldn&#39;t think about it so much better to be honest. But it was an awesome movie and is it just me? Or does janice look like vanessa hunters

@DrewElGringasho,2024-02-28T04:51:01Z,2024-02-28T04:51:01Z,1,Why would you remake this.  This movie was perfect.  Such a great moment in America
@Sargon_Aelther,2024-02-28T01:01:38Z,2024-02-28T01:01:38Z,1,"So upvote for the movie, downvote for the trailer. Why hide the fact that it was a musical? I actually like musicals and I was going to completely skip this movie, because I saw nothing special about it in the trailer. At the same time you will annoy people who dislike musicals... So what was the point? My sister casually told me that it was a musical so I went to see it, but I would have otherwise ignored it."

All of them are just not quite the “build” of the same size with them being wide or extremely gargantuan. Two are awful picks to play mean girls…actually two really don’t fit and the others don’t fit either literally (into sizes smaller then large). Wow Rachelle McAdams, Amanda Syfried, Lacey Chabert and Lindsay Lohan these girls are NOT lol. They’re not even the type that would be known as mean girls because ya…mean girls are definitely not gargantuan in proportion either way. I can’t get over gigantor herself the 6’2 girl that really doesn’t fit in haha…these are the girls that would be made fun of by real mean girls."

There&#39;s literally a music note in the logo. They don&#39;t have to call it Mean Girls: The Musical and put the soundtrack in the trailer in order to tell people that it&#39;s a musical.

This movie also seems that the target audience is the same. So for the original target audience to have kids old enough to be the target audience of this movie, they would&#39;ve had to have had kids straight out of high school, which probably a few did, but not enough for it to be a common thing. So the makers of this movie either don&#39;t know when the original came out, they don&#39;t know how to do math, or they just wanted to say that because they though it sounds cool regardless of if it makes sense logistically"

@terichristensen7932,2024-01-10T22:41:54Z,2024-01-10T22:41:54Z,0,Hollywood is having a hard time being original. They just keep doing sequels and they cannot match the originals!
@kimberlybeth,2024-01-10T22:40:40Z,2024-01-10T22:40:40Z,0,I’m still on the fence of seeing this in theaters. I’m worried about not liking it. I’m not worried about wasting money but I’ll clock out in the first 10 minutes if I don’t like it then have to sit through 2 hours. I’m open to various adaptions of stories and im a fan of musicals and theater so I’m more open to give this a try.

Clearly intentional not to include any of it, mmm. Wonder if that will turn off a segment of us OG Mean Girls original fans from back in the day. Studio &amp; Marketing is not embracing the Broadway show. How weird"
@AcePlaysTCGs,2024-01-08T02:31:29Z,2024-01-08T02:31:29Z,0,"If there ever was a movie that called for a new look every 20 years or so, it&#39;s probably this one. I&#39;m sure, based on this trailer, the dialogue won&#39;t be much different, but some of the approaches will be very different. We can already tell there will be a tik tok/internet/influencer presence that the story would definitely benefit from including. 2004 predates YouTube. Just because this could be a Mean Girls for the next generation doesn&#39;t mean it has to unseat the 2004 one as a classic. If they remade Breakfast Club, it would include a lot of advanced technology, but the more things change, the more they stay the same. High school is all about finding yourself in a world where fitting in is the name of the game and I have faith in this iteration. It&#39;s got a lot of the same people behind it both on camera and in production. It&#39;s going to be just as fun as the original with a few new generational tweaks. Sign me up."

@Specific_Hazard,2024-01-01T15:47:11Z,2024-01-01T15:47:11Z,1,So this is a musical? Not once did the trailer hint at that. This seems like a beat by beat remake.

@stell4rw1nd,2024-01-01T07:56:58Z,2024-01-01T07:59:05Z,20,"I remember watching the second part of “Mean Girls”  2011, and it wasn&#39;t at all the same, even bad. What can outshine the 2004 film? I think even Walmart&#39;s Black Friday ad was more brilliant than anything that could be done in the future.😂 By the way, Ariana Grande’s “thank u next” turned out quite normal. Oddly enough, I&#39;ll still watch this new film, but the classic of the genre is the 2004 version! I love these girls!😍😍"

I like the nostalgia feels and I&#39;m interested in the message of mean girls being retold as many times as possible. One of the&quot; lessons&quot; of the mean girl movie was to not be soo mean and critical of other people for being authentic and true to who they are. I just care about being entertained at the very least. I don&#39;t need it to live up to what was. 😊

We are witnessing this same behavior with the new Wonka movie. Why are they afraid to admit that they are musical renditions?

@higurashianduminekoconnect1702,2023-12-25T00:30:14Z,2023-12-25T00:30:14Z,0,They should just make a movie called The remake the movie and just be a remake for every film and existence into one movie. After all that&#39;s Hollywood concept of original by never being original. The movie was made in 2024 I would say I&#39;m shocked that it was that young before they made it into a remake. However I&#39;ve seen Hollywood literally remake a movie a year later. Just one word Death at a Funeral it was remade literally a year later. They even touch the movie they should have never touched the one I said that they would that everyone said they would never touch The Exorcist. I said it was going to be a sewer fire. 🔥 however it exceeded my expectations on how horrible it&#39;s going to be it is the most awful offensive rip off to all humanity and it needs be erased just like the ET vidoe game. That&#39;s not sarcasm by the way that&#39;s legit throw all the movies Exorcist remake into a landfill. Burn 🔥 it on top of that. The director actually wants to make two more movies I say don&#39;t do that instead walk away in disgrace and let us all see it. She deserves to be seen walking away and disgrace by everyone. I think I speak on everyone&#39;s behalf when I say no we will not give another one of your movies a chance go away.

I like the way the cast looks (ironically absent of cosmetic work, considering the title of &quot;Plastics&quot;), but it does seem to be lacking in comedy. I also always thought that Gretchen was half black (Maybe Lacey Chabert is? She looks black to me, at least), but there&#39;s no way they&#39;d cast a white girl for the role of she were 🤔. It&#39;s not that important, she just looks nothing like Gretchen while the other cast members are easy to identify as their characters. Admittedly, the Walmart black Friday ad looked more interesting, though."

@NicoleMiami,2023-12-05T08:27:52Z,2023-12-05T08:27:52Z,1,i&#39;m honestly super excited i like that it isn&#39;t going to be a mean girls ripoff (ie MG2) it&#39;s based off the musical as we have all acknowledged and the portrayal truly is very different and also carries a lot of similarities within the icon status that the original Mean Girls has
@ashb6393,2023-12-05T08:12:28Z,2023-12-05T08:12:28Z,0,I&#39;m a little disappointed the Facebook rumors were wrong. Someone was saying it was the original cast of Mean Girls but their daughters going to high school together. Was expecting to see Lindsey Lohan pop up until I realized the names were all the same😂

It doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s an adaptation or a remake, same as the second part. of Mean Girls. Yes, the sequel is really existing. This copies the icon and doesn&#39;t bring anything new. Absolutely not a charismatic caste, except for the &quot;oldies&quot; from the original. An absolutely boring trailer. The scenes don&#39;t carry any aesthetics. It&#39;s a flop. Even a reunion from walmart looks like a worthy candidate for sequels than this."

@Andy2481,2023-11-27T04:08:53Z,2023-11-27T04:08:53Z,0,Dont wana be negative but this looks terrible. The original in 2004 was great. One of the reasons was the dialogue from Regina and other stuff that wasnt politically correct. You just know this new one will be terrible and wont have any of that and also it looks like the same old forced diverse casting with this generation of movies. But Tina Fay looks the exact same from 20 years ago .... mind blowing.

@fishercourt,2023-11-21T17:49:57Z,2023-11-21T17:49:57Z,0,I wish they were able to get all of the ladies from the original movie to be mothers of the children.  I mean it’s been a long time since that was made and if Tina Fey really cared then she would have made sure that at LEAST the original cast would have cameos.  Waste of money in my opinion.  I want this to flop so they lose their investment into trying to make fetch happen again.

@audreyyippie,2023-11-14T11:18:43Z,2023-11-14T11:18:43Z,115,I entrust the screenplay entirely to Tina Fey and I know that this version will be just as funny as the 2004&#39;s version with the twist of the new generation&#39;s humor. Tina knows what she&#39;s doing and she is brilliant at what she does.

@dogtired1,2023-11-11T15:56:59Z,2023-11-11T15:56:59Z,2,why would a musical remake use no music from the musical to convey it&#39;s a remake and instead use DIFFERENT generic popular music unless they are trying to hide from audiences this is a musical--which kind of backfired because now everyone is complaining about the reason for even doing a remake of the movie

They could have brought them back. It could have been a different story. We don&#39;t want a copy of the original. None of the fans will want to see this."

Regardless, I just don&#39;t really like the concept. Maybe they will somehow play into it again or make cameos, but the original mean girls or original four as the parents would have been better or Lindsay as the guidance counselor like in the recent Wal-Mart commerical would have made more sense. That commercial was more entertaining than this trailer. If others like it that is great and I hope it knocks my socks off, but as it stands, not really feeling it. Again, I love Tina and Tim. They are just great."

It devolves into how Regina’s, and Katy’s assets dissolves into them being pretty, popular, thin, and fashionable. And I would think with Tina Fey being a writer on the original she would understand the importance of casting/ clothing the plastics and Katy in a way that suits the narrative of the film… but no they resolved to putting them in literal shein clothes, ruining the cast,  and using soon to be dated social media references.

The quaver in the ‘A’ of ‘Mean’ just doesn’t cut it.<br>The trailer misrepresents that this is a film adaptation of the of stage show/musical. People are already hating on it thinking its just a redux.

Or at least not this dramatically. There are popular girls but ppl aren’t <b>this</b> obsessed with them and I feel like bullying has changed over the years so now ppl don’t bully as obviously, it’s more like emotionally breaking ppl down and just gossiping about them but not public humiliation or elaborate schemes. To be fair this does happen a bit in the original movie. Also this is just my opinion don’t come for me"

But I wonder if they&#39;ll still do the subplot where Regina tries to lose weight, in view of all the body positivity stuff, and the fact that Renee is about the size that Regina became when she <b>put on</b> weight (NOT fat-shaming, cos, like I say, I think curvy women like Rapp look hot)."

That critique is that we have not gotten anything super original out of Hollywood in almost a decade and I’m kind of sick of it. All we get are sequels and remakes of movies that were done perfectly about 20 years ago. Why can’t anyone in Hollywood try something new? It’s getting real old watching them try to make classics from my childhood and changing them for a “modern audience”. They don’t need to do that, just tell new stories. There are billions of stories out there that can be told. I’d be ecstatic for this if I weren’t inundated with remakes and sequels already. Now I’m just worried it’s going to pale in comparison to the original."

This 2024 version also has much MUCH better lighting than the original; probably cause this one has a higher budget than the original one ever did. That being said, this not only needs to have entertaining songs but also a very sharp sense of humor, which I sort of got from the clips of this trailer that parodied TikTok videos, Mean Girls style. I think I’m rather interested in this more so than I expected since I did not like the teaser for this movie that they showed during the Eras film in theaters."

@IHARumor,2023-11-08T15:43:37Z,2023-11-08T15:43:37Z,4,Weird that they’re not calling it ‘Mean Girls The Musical’. Since that’s what it’s an adaptation from. This just makes it seem like it’s a straight up remake. They do that even use any of the songs from the musical itself. <br><br>It does seem like Tina added several new elements though. For example the joke about Regina’s ‘wet look’ isn’t in the stage musical (it probably replaces the joke about the holes cut in her shirt from the original movie).

Just like literally every other movie musical trailer does. Show them singing and or dancing. This makes it look like a remake no one asked for instead of a movie musical. Bad trailer.

It will spoil the movie if the music becomes too familiar already and I&#39;m sure they made changes and surprises from the broadway musical. They will probably start teasing the musical numbers next month.

@Slicedude2004,2023-11-08T14:20:36Z,2023-11-08T14:21:35Z,3,Looks like a decent remake of the original but for a musical adaptation they didn&#39;t show any of that..? I honestly think the Eras Tour movie trailer did a better job.
