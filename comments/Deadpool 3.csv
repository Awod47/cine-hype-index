So when deadpool was in search of a wolverine he stumble to upon a world where he met Hugh Jackman(the worlverine actor) instead of the real worlverine. Just imagine our real world is inside the multiverse. That would be cool.

Wade Wilson (Deadpool) travels in Endgame timeline and bring Tony (Iron Man), Steve (Captain America),Natasha (Black widow) Hawkeye, Thor, Hulk and Thanos and bring them in Doomsday or Secret wars timeline to defeat Dr Doom. This will make marvel fans happy. Similar what he did to bring wolverine back."

I remember this trailer coming out. I was at the lowest point in my life, thinking about s**de and had no will to continue trying fixing my life and pulling myself together. I remember texting my friend about these thoughts and him being really worried about me and his constant signs of concern. He was really trying to help which I&#39;m thankful to him for. Then this trailer came out and suddenly I realized that I really really needed to see this movie and how could I see it if I ended everything back then? So, I told myself that I would try my best to live the following 6 months before the movie premier and that I would go and watch this movie and have amazing time. And I did. I went to see that movie with my friends whom I really appreciate and thankful for being there for me. And I thank you, D&amp;W, for keeping me alive and giving me a small goal to live for. By the time I watched the movie I had already put my life together. I&#39;d fixed my schedule, started going to the gym, quit the job I hated, been much more open to my family and it&#39;s just feels amazing now. I doubt that Ryan or anyone else who&#39;s been behind of making this movie will read this, but nonetheless, THANK YOU. U really did save my life!"

@DaviRoutner,2024-10-09T00:14:43Z,2024-10-09T00:14:43Z,0,"Rewatching Deadpool 3, or as many call it, “Deadpool and Wolverine,” makes it clear that the film is essentially an exaggerated egotrip by Ryan Reynolds. The actor, producer, writer, presenter, entrepreneur, and comedian seems to use the film as a personal showcase, saturating every scene with his extremely forced persona.<br><br>The first movie of the franchise is acceptable, the second one starts to get tiring, but the third provokes deep antipathy—not so much toward the character, but toward the actor. Reynolds pushes his irreverence to the limit, turning the film into an egocentric indulgence where he delights in himself.<br><br>The plot is chaotic and seems to exist only to make room for an endless string of jokes. The storyline takes a back seat so that Deadpool’s character can monopolize the screen with shallow sarcasms that add nothing new. The presence of other iconic characters feels like nothing more than an excuse to boost Reynolds’ personal show, as if the movie were an awkward fanfic where he is the absolute protagonist.<br><br>Hugh Jackman’s return as Wolverine seems like a marketing ploy to attract audiences, but in the end, viewers are met with endless dialogues of inflated ego. What could have been an interesting interaction is lost in forced, unsubstantial lines.<br><br>In short, Deadpool 3 is a dull, tiresome, and pretentious film. Little entertainment, lots of irrelevance, and, above all, too much Ryan Reynolds. If I had to rate it, it would be a 3.5/10. It’s not a film worth watching more than once."

But honestly its not even what FOX wanted it to be back in 2016. Its sad to me that Disney puts out garbage like this where every sentence contains the &quot;F&quot; bomb or &quot;MF&quot; bomb I can take the cussing but it truly shows the lack of directing and writing skill that play into an unintelligent writer and director. This is not a superhero movie at all and it doesn&#39;t even tell a story line its actors that put on costumes we all know and were dropped a script to sell their soul for a buck. I am disappointed in Hugh Jackman and Ryan Reynolds, Not to mention Jennifer Gardner.  All 3 of these actors said they were proud to make a movie their kids could watch, what a joke! Do not waste your money on Amazon for 24.99 bucks wait for it to decrease, and if you let your kids watch this then you aren&#39;t watching your kids. Marvel you should be ashamed of letting your franchise be destroyed by this crap of a Studio."

I know both know each other from the first Wolwering and Blade as I know Ryan was in one of the films. Is a Blade come back? I laugh so much when the short Wolf and the def dog or the dead’s fighting each other and Wolf with the dog like that is not my business A good one to put him back

@RUS38,2024-09-19T12:22:23Z,2024-09-19T12:22:23Z,1,Just got back from watching this trash. Wasted time! There were a few funny scenes but I would rather spend 10 minutes watching them on YT or something. A movie for the modern generation of schoolers. Not worth if you are over 15 years of mentally developed age. First Deadpool movie is where it should have ended. This is only gonna make me think not twice but three times before going to a cinema next time. It was the first time after 5 months that I visited cinema after doubting even going there and I should’ve listened my gut. I would’ve rather spent time at home watching some movie from the 90s or 80s that I haven’t yet seen. I will never trust any comment on the new movie as they seem to be either generated by AI or at&amp;pid kids. This is the world we live in today. Another 👎 movie!

@viosavvy,2024-09-10T07:05:21Z,2024-09-10T07:05:21Z,1,Guess I was the only one who thought this movie sucked. One of the laziest storylines of any Marvel movie. The fighting scenes all felt the same to me. The villain was ok and there were some funny parts. I seriously think the writers came up with the plot of the entire movie within a thirty minute zoom call. I&#39;d give it a 4/10.

@elainegmorrison,2024-09-08T04:55:44Z,2024-09-08T18:29:24Z,2,"I fell asleep, then I wish I had stayed there. That running Deadpool speech is tiresome. I just don&#39;t get this talky movie. Maybe if I had been 12, and allowed to watch it if not for all the vulgar language. It had some interesting action scenes but the music choices were strange and they chopped up the movie in between the never-ending rambling about nothing with that whiny irritating voice from an actor who is often brilliant. Maybe it was written during the writers&#39; strike. Why? Why?<br>I just thought of one thing which could have helped as I was at a complete loss earlier. Maybe choose a great song as a theme (it&#39;s hackneyed but the idea is coming...) and that becomes a running joke. When the character gives the line and the look we know the theme song is coming. Another character can even give an &quot;oh brother, not again&quot; expression. And when the character is revved up for a fight and the music starts someone else can direct him &quot;not now&quot; and the music cuts. Or the character searching for identity and greatness can search for a theme song and the other characters can critique it. &quot;You actually hear that? I thought it was in my head&quot;, &quot;Of course I can hear it. I&#39;m not deaf and your music choices are disturbing&quot; kind of thing.<br>Maybe since the movie was so talky the dialogue could be really high level meaning of life philosophy. And the characters would be on the move instead of standing around arguing. It doesn&#39;t have to be linear and real. They could be walking on a different plane of existence while having these esoteric conversations and you&#39;d have to get some experts to give you the material. It&#39;s a movie and it&#39;s not real anyway so you can suspend the reality even more to make it interesting. Often the best innovation, the aha moment, comes from pulling rabbits out of hats to fix a problem."

@СергейАкимов-ъ9р,2024-08-26T15:34:44Z,2024-08-26T15:34:44Z,0,"Надо всегда говорить ПРЯМО. ВСЁ ИСКУССТВО: КИНО, ТЕАТР, МУЗЫКА, КНИГИ, ПОЭЗИЯ, ЖИВОПИСЬ имеет ИСКЛЮЧИТЕЛЬНО ДВА ГЛОБАЛЬНЫХ СМЫСЛА , либо служит ПРОСЛАВЛЕНИЮ БОЖЬЕГО СЛОВА , либо дьяволу. СЛУЖИТЬ БОЖЬЕМУ СЛОВУ это значит, каждым КАДРОМ, РЕПЛИКОЙ, КУПЛЕТОМ и т.п. &quot;ПРИВОДИТЬ&quot; НАС, ЗРИТЕЛЕЙ, СЛУШАТЕЛЕЙ к ПОКАЯНИЮ, СПАСЕНИЮ ДУШИ, и соответственно наоборот, максимально удалять от него.<br><br>МЕРЗКОЕ сатанинское КИНО. ДЬЯВОЛЬСКАЯ НАСМЕШКА, И пример МАНИПУЛЯЦИИ ДУШОЙ человека, а ПОЧЕМУ надо понимать следующее. НО СНАЧАЛА. Любое НЕ УПОМИНАНИЕ(где бы то ни было) об Отце нашем небесном, подарившим для наших душ жизнь вечную, которая может испытывать такую блаженственную радость, но мы сами не хотим этого своей греховной жизнью, И также любое УПОМИНАНИЕ О БОГЕ в фильме  ВСУЕ(что значит обращения к Богу без молитвы и благовейного состояния), И СЛОВА ЛЮБОВЬ потому что Бог есть Любовь, ВСЁ ЭТО обычное мелкопакостное БОГОХУЛЬСТВО(ХУЛА на ДУХА СВЯТОГО). НО БОГА ОБИДЕТЬ НЕ ВОЗМОЖНО ОН БЕССТРАСТЕН, А вот ХУЛА ЕГО это БОЛЬШОЙ ГРЕХ. А ГРЕХ это РАНА которую человек наносит прежде всего сам СВОЕЙ ДУШЕ. РАНА которая ОТКРЫВАЕТ ДУШУ ДЛЯ ДЕМОНОВ мучителей, БЕСОВ ПОРОЧНЫХ СТРАСТЕЙ, слуг дьявола. Сам же ФИЛЬМ НАМЕРЕННО «РАЗЖИГАЕТ», но В ДУШАХ самих ЗРИТЕЛЕЙ, действие множества страшных ПОРОЧНЫХ СТРАСТЕЙ(наши духовные болезни) таких как, ЛУКАВСТВО, ГОРДЫНЯ, ТЩЕСЛАВИЕ(ПАГУБНАЯ СТРАСТЬ К ЛЮДСКОЙ СЛАВЕ), ЗАВИСТЬ, ЧЕЛОВЕКОУГОДИЕ, ГНЕВ, НЕНАВИСТЬ, МЕСТЬ, НЕМОЩЬ, ПОХОТЬ, БЛУД, КУРЕНИЕ, ВИНОПИТИЕ. И ВОТ ТАК, ОГРОМНОЕ БОЛЬШИНСТВО ЛЮДЕЙ (не понимают), и ВОЛЬНО ИЛИ НЕ ВОЛЬНО СОГРЕШАЮТ(не вольно значит что, грех только у себя в уме, под действием той или иной порочной страсти, является таким же грехом), И ДЬЯВОЛ «ВВОДИТ» В ДУШУ человека ДЕМОНОВ МУЧИТЕЛЕЙ разных ПОРОЧНЫХ СТРАСТЕЙ. Ну А «ОБЩЕНИЕ» человека в жизни С любым собственным ДЕМОНОМ, «ПРИВЕДЁТ» рано или поздно только к одному, или К ПСИХИЧЕСКОМУ РАССТРОЙСТВУ, или УБИЙСТВУ, или САМОУБИЙСТВУ. И к АДУ для ДУШИ после физической СМЕРТИ тела. И ПОЧЕМУ МАНИПУЛЯЦИЯ. «ПРИОРИТЕТНЫМИ» демонами которые завладевают душой человека при просмотре фильма, если конечно они уже не находятся в душе, а если находятся тогда усиливаются бесами соответствующей порочной страсти, потому что они фактически из них и состоят, БУДУТ ДЕМОНЫ МУЧИТЕЛИ ВИНОПИТИЯ И БЛУДА, ПОТОМУ ЧТО КАК реально примерно ВЫГЛЯДЯТ ЭТИ ДЕМОНЫ, в своём и «человеческом» и «демоническом» виде, ПОКАЗАНО В этом ФИЛЬМЕ. ПОЭТОМУ при просмотре таких фильмов ЗАЩИТА тоже существует. ЕСЛИ СОГРЕШИЛ (даже только в мыслях, в данном случае почувствовал проявление в своей душе пороков записанных выше), надо сразу же ПРОИЗНОСИТЬ МОЛИТВУ ГОСПОДА нашего ИИСУСА ХРИСТА. «ГОСПОДИ ИИСУСЕ ХРИСТЕ СЫНЕ БОЖИЙ СПАСИ И ПОМИЛУЙ МЕНЯ ГРЕШНОГО». И что ещё имеет смысл в этом фильме. В одном из кадров образно показаны(опять же в виде насмешки, потому что мало зрителей понимают что реально происходит в фильме) взаимоотношения в душе живого человека между этими демонами и вторым демоном мучителем лукавства(да их в душе человека два, есть ещё и основной). И ВОТ как БЫЛО БЫ ХОРОШО, ЧТОБЫ КАЖДЫЙ зритель ПОНИМАЛ это. НО ЭТО очень «глубокие» моменты, ПОНЯТЬ которые МОЖНО будет ТОЛЬКО ЧИТАЯ, И ГЛАВНОЕ, ИЗУЧАЯ КНИГУ ЖИЗНИ, СВЯТОЕ ЕВАНГЕЛИЕ.<br><br>А ПОЧЕМУ мы ВСЕ БОЛЬНЫ. После ГРЕХОПАДЕНИЯ АДАМА и ЕВЫ они были ИЗГНАНЫ ИЗ РАЯ. ДО грехопадения они ЖИЛИ В РАЮ подобно АНГЕЛАМ. После, БОГ одел их в «одежды» что значит в тела, и ДАЛ ЗАПОВЕДЬ «ПЛОДИТЕСЬ и РАЗМНОЖАЙТЕСЬ» и заселяйте Землю. НО для размножения, В ПОЛОВЫЕ ОТНОШЕНИЯ ПРИХОДИЛОСЬ ВСТУПАТЬ БРАТУ С СЕСТРОЙ. И ЭТО было вызвано необходимостью а НЕ ПОХОТЬЮ. И ВОТ ПОЧЕМУ КАЖДЫЙ рождающийся ребёнок уже ГРЕШЕН.  Только не физическое(физическое если вызвано похотью, между родными братьями и сёстрами), а так называемое ПЕРВОРОДНОЕ (ДУХОВНОЕ , ПРИЧИНА которого ГРЕХОПАДЕНИЕ) ПОВРЕЖДЕНИЕ(ГРЕХ, ПОРОЧНАЯ СТРАСТЬ) НА КАЖДОМ человеке при рождении. И У КАЖДОГО человека своя СОБСТВЕННАЯ СТРАСТЬ. И ЭТО БОЛЕЗНЬ, но БОЛЕЗНЬ прежде всего ДУХОВНОГО ПЛАНА.  И именно ПОРОЧНЫЕ СТРАСТИ людей являются ПРИЧИНОЙ ВСЕХ БЕД, СТРАДАНИЙ, и РАЗРУШИТЕЛЬНЫХ ДЕЙСТВИЙ на Земле. А вот условия ОСВОБОЖДЕНИЯ ОТ этого ПЕРВОРОДНОГО ГРЕХА(ПОВРЕЖДЕНИЯ, СТРАСТИ) как раз и ЗАПИСАНЫ в КНИГЕ ЖИЗНИ, СВЯТОМ ЕВАНГЕЛИЕ. НО СНАЧАЛА , чтобы донести их людям,  сам СЫН, БОГ СЛОВО ВОЧЕЛОВЕЧИЛСЯ(ИИСУС ХРИСТОС, имя ИИСУС означает СПАСИТЕЛЬ). А ЕГО за это РАСПЯЛИ. Но ОСТАЛОСЬ СВЯТОЕ ЕВАНГЕЛИЕ. Вот ЭТО и есть БОЖЕСТВЕННЫЕ УСЛОВИЯ , во первых ИЗБАВЛЕНИЯ ОТ ПЕРВОРОДНОГО ГРЕХА(а правильней сказать от ПОВРЕЖДЕНИЯ), И во вторых ДЛЯ СПАСЕНИЯ ДУШИ человеческой, ПОЛУЧЕНИЯ ЖИЗНИ ВЕЧНОЙ для ДУШИ, ПОСЛЕ физической СМЕРТИ тела , В ЦАРСТВИЕ НЕБЕСНОМ.<br><br>И ГЛАВНОЕ. ИСТИННАЯ ВЕРА В БОГА, в первую очередь ЗАКЛЮЧАЕТСЯ В «БОРЬБЕ» каждого ЧЕЛОВЕКА, ПРИ ЗЕМНОЙ ЖИЗНИ, СО своими собственными ПОРОЧНЫМИ СТРАСТЯМИ, И только ТАК можно получить СПАСЕНИЕ для своей ДУШИ.<br><br>Ну А для того ЧТОБЫ ПОНЯТЬ ВСЁ что ЗАПИСАНО выше, И для ИСКРЕННЕГО ХРИСТИАНСКОГО ПОКАЯНИЯ, которое необходимо УСПЕТЬ(потому что ВРЕМЕНИ осталось очень МАЛО, ВОЗМОЖНО даже ПРИМЕРНО 4 МЕСЯЦА, И ВСЁ(смотри СВЯТОЕ ЕВАНГЕЛИЕ от МАТФЕЯ, ГЛ. 24)) СДЕЛАТЬ ПРИ ЗЕМНОЙ ЖИЗНИ ЧЕЛОВЕКА, ПЕРВЫМ &quot;шагом&quot; будет (и как об этом уже упоминалось выше) ЧТЕНИЕ и ГЛАВНОЕ, ИЗУЧЕНИЕ КНИГИ ЖИЗНИ, СВЯЩЕННОГО ПИСАНИЯ НОВЫЙ ЗАВЕТ. ✋"

I was in the second grade when that launched. Deadpool is perverted beyond belief. It was a garbage movie with a minivan honda pilot  placement. Do better you, lazy script writers. These ideas of depressed superheros is not attractive. You&#39;re looking for depressed i can turn on memphis News and have a ball. 😅"

This movie needed to be ten times darker, vengeful with a world full of characters pissed off. Felt like some Musical for the family, these characters suppose to the working class adults escape, and it didn’t feel that freaking way. To darn bright, the movie PITCH BLACK seemed darker and it was on a world with 3 suns. Total waste of money, to watch and make!!!"

AND when he was acting in the green lantern movie with Blake Lively (Ryan and Blake messed around) ...Ryan ended his engagement with Scarlett and.... Ryan Reynolds started dating Blake Lively and had kids and married....... NOW I BELIEVE BLAKE HAS ALWAYS BEEN JEALOUS OF SCARLETT, SO BLAKE BEGGED RYAN TO LET BLAKE BE THE FEMALE DEADPOOL ..... because Scarlett is a more talented and successful actress. Scarlett is hotter. Scarlett gets along with her costars. Scarlett was amazing in black widow and the advengers.... but yeah Blake being the &quot;lady deadpool&quot; was so forced and pathetic<br>Scarlett Johansson is a natural beauty. Whereas Blake Lively had to get a nose job to be a 5 out of 10, go watch &quot;sisterhood of the traveling pants&quot; to see her old big nose 😅 😂"

Therefore the first 2 Deadpool are set in 2029+ but somehow also in the time line of the X - Men first class due to their appearance in DP2 in 80&#39;s themed Clothing/ages (Mainly Quicksilver) so James McAvoy is the Charles Xavier of Deadpools timeline, but Patrick Stewart is The Prof X of the MCU?

I have to tell parents out there that if this is something that you allow your young kids to see or read  I guess, you really are an awful parent.  I tried to leave but it was at a drive in theater.  To the person that said &quot;God bless deadpool&quot;, God would never bless the filthy mouths and disturbed killings over and over again.  The comments that I read says to me humanity is really screwed up and lost.  This was by far disturbing and the worst movie I&#39;ve ever seen in my years."

My fav was Blade. So happy to see him and Wolverine actually wearing his costume. The Madonna music placement on that epic scene was so cool. The villain staying a villain. Thank the heavens. The jokes were funny. Love it. Love it. LOVE IT!

@andreasstavrinou7396,2024-08-11T15:07:10Z,2024-08-11T15:07:10Z,3,This is ridiculous. Pointless battles. Too many universes too many heroes mixed together for no reason. The whole movie was a mess. The storyline it does not make sense. Batman and catwoman superman and joker from DC universe was absent from this chaos of a movie. It felt like a parody instead of a movie. Sheer disappointment. You spoiled iconic cartoon characters Waste of time! Sorry Fox! I mean Disney!

I have always been a marvel fan since I was a teenager and I&#39;ve always been a fan of the original xmen movies and wolverine too. I heard that there are lot of cameos in it. I will watch this when it hits some free streaming apps and I know that will be a long wait but I&#39;m fine with that. I should watch deadpool 2 and watch the rest of logan as well.

@toxicsugar6455,2024-08-01T23:23:31Z,2024-08-01T23:23:31Z,0,My favorite thing in this movie is how they destroyed the character of Cassandra nova. The super old lady with the ringle dead expression face turned to the most generic bald chick ever 😂 no wonder why people watching these movies think she is the ancient one from dr stange movies..i mean its two bald women 😅 pretty much the same stuff. At least they could give the role to an older woman but its hollywood. People want their cassandra Nova young with a flawless skin and wolverine extra ripped and tall. And many many explosions 😅

@abishai619,2024-08-01T13:35:32Z,2024-08-01T13:35:32Z,1,I saw this Movie yesterday PARENTS BEWARE Let me be clear I am a Superhero Fan and have enjoyed the Deadpool series to this point. Good vs Evil where Good always wins is heart felt. This bastardization of that theme was gratuitously raunchy filled with way too many sexual innuendos. Granted its was funny when injected sparingly but this was over the top. Parents should know this is non stop lude and lascivious behavior. Add to that non stop killing beyond what you would see in a Horror Film granted excellent special effects awesome CGI but again gratuitous over the top non stop killing. It was as if on purpose to illustrate how absurd movies of this type are. A satire of sort&#39;s. I felt bad for the parents who brought their children to see it. I actually saw a group get up and leave. IMHO it is a sad day when someone thinks this is Family entertainment. I know I know I understand the ratings system an &quot;R&#39; means don&#39;t take kids but we all know that is sometimes ignored and Deadpool/Superhero movies are some of those many would. Bottom line this is a Stag Party movie shame on Disney for abusing there persona. I&#39;ve resisted canceling them in the past but as much as I hate doing it they are dead to me now.

@fomobull4187,2024-07-31T20:58:35Z,2024-07-31T20:58:35Z,2,"Do not waste your money, this is literally the worst movie I have ever watched, I felt like leaving early but I thought it would be awkward. I have never watched these X-men before. It looks like you are supposed to watch the old movies first. I expected a superhero movie like Batman or Superman. But it is actually a comedy movie that parodies itself. They do not bother to explain what the multiverse is or any of the backstory. The movie is loaded with references to past movies in this series, none of which make sense. The actors speak into the camera and speak directly to the viewers and take jabs at rival movie studios, very meta. That was mildly fun, like, haha, ok, whatever.<br><br>I am uncertain if the movie had a story. I struggled not to fall asleep at one point. Something about preventing the destruction of a universe. The path to the ending seemed to be a string of comedy sketches that were not well connected. I guess the fan base must be in their 40s because they played a few old 80s hits for no good reason.<br><br>This series seems to have a fan base of sorts. Don&#39;t kill me, this is just how I experienced the movie."

@FreeWhilly734,2024-07-30T15:44:18Z,2024-07-30T15:44:18Z,0,I think dead pool and wolverine probably just saved the fox universe never mind Disney. Your telling me they&#39;re gonna let it die when this crosses 1 billion in revenue. Not a chance Ryan just got the green light to make anything he wants now with who ever he wants they&#39;ll be chucking money at him by the truck load.<br><br>When the cameos started honestly wow i just wanted more and more. The only thing they could have done was at the end when we got 100 dead pools was we got 100 characters from the fox universe instead. Dead pool could have done an avengers asemble rip off but with fox characters.

Things have been kinda rough in my life rn so it was really nice to forget everything and focus on the ridiculousness (the good kind) of the movie 😂 it also made me want to watch the X-Men trilogy and Logan so I could understand d&amp;w better next time I watch cause I was lost not even gonna lie. I miss the peak of the mcu and hope one day it will go back to being something everyone enjoyed!<br><br>Also this movie would be nothing without Mary Puppins 🐕

@sontranxuan2090,2024-07-28T23:34:30Z,2024-07-28T23:34:30Z,2,"To be honest, I don&#39;t like this film very much, it still funny and I used to really like X-men, but some of the characters last appeared on screen about 10 years ago, and I was hardly impressed with them, and with the plot this movie just copied the old famous scenes. The characters are hollow, especially the 2 villains, they appeared and were defeated in a rather silly way. I mean the script is pretty bad, like recent marvel movies. <br>I&#39;m starting to get tired of movies being made just to serve as an introduction to the characters in Avenger 5 and 6 and not being able to understand without watching the other movies about each characters first, or having forgotten them all. This movie literally just introduces old characters are coming back and possibly will appear in Avengers 5. There are no feelings left in me after watching the movie."

@arpitsinghthakur1997,2024-07-28T12:03:01Z,2024-07-28T12:03:01Z,0,"Spoilers ahead.<br><br>1.) The timeline in some Marvel films is incorrect. Like in the movie Deadpool 2, when Deadpool goes to Xavier Mansion, we are shown the younger form of Charles Xavier, Quick Silver, Beast, Cylops in a room, the same form which was shown to us in X-Men Apocalypse, Dark Phoenix i.e. the year 1983. But in the movie Deadpool 2, the year 2018 is going on.<br><br>2.) The year 2023 is shown in X-Men Days of Future Past and the year 2029 in Logan. So have Professor X and Logan become so old in just 6 years? In Deadpool 3, Deadpool tells Wolverine that you are very respected in my world. You was the X-Man, you was the main X-Man, The Wolverine. Was...means Wolverine is dead now. In Deadpool 3, the year is 2024, so Logan will die after 5 years.<br><br><br>Marvel is confused about timeline."

The humour and soundtrack were great... but, if I had to criticize anything, I would say I wished there were more MCU cameos, (but I guess I&#39;m just a greedy MCU fan) some of the side characters were a bit 2-dimensional, but, even then, the main characters were pretty good. Oh, and the special effects and acting were good and the emotional moments were decent.<br><br>So, yeah, if you liked or loved the first 2 Deadpool movies and the other marvel movies, I&#39;d say go see this. Oh, and make sure you&#39;ve seen the first season of Loki... that got referenced quite a bit."

The F word was flying all the time left and right and it felt like I was watching a musical movie? Lots of 80s and 90s music played!!! Ryan Reynolds who is a one trick poney was ANNOYING as USUAL with his over the top acting!!! Some people were laughing at the jokes which I didnot find funny at all… Marvel movies are redundant!

Furthermore, Ryan and Hugh have better chemistry than any other actual couple haha."

@mehmetsahcicekdag8416,2024-07-16T18:19:49Z,2024-07-16T18:19:49Z,0,"Deadpool and Wolverine: A Fun Review and Commentary 🎬😂<br><br>Let&#39;s talk about Deadpool and Wolverine being in the same movie! I watched the trailer for &quot;Deadpool and Wolverine: Together,&quot; and having these two characters on screen together promises to deliver all kinds of comedy and action explosions. Now, let&#39;s have some fun with this review, shall we? 😂<br><br>Deadpool: The Talkative Superhero 🗣️💥<br><br>What does Deadpool do? The guy cracks jokes in every scene, his style is legendary. Imagine Mike from your local coffee shop sitting down next to Deadpool and saying, &quot;Man, you talk too much, give it a rest and have some coffee.&quot; 😂 When Deadpool&#39;s humor meets our everyday banter, laughter is guaranteed!<br><br>Wolverine: Grumpy but Charismatic 🐺🦸‍♂️<br><br>Wolverine, on the other hand, is the ultimate grump, but also incredibly charismatic. This guy has claws and every fight scene is him basically saying, &quot;Mess with me and you&#39;ll get hurt.&quot; Picture Jake from your local gym watching Wolverine and saying, &quot;This guy is a total badass!&quot; 😂 Grumpy yet charismatic, a perfect blend for an action hero.<br><br> Dynamic Duo: Contrast and Harmony 🎭🤝<br><br>What happens when these two come together? Deadpool keeps talking, and Wolverine just gives him that grumpy look. But it&#39;s exactly this contrast that creates their unique harmony. Imagine putting Chatty Mike and Grumpy Jake in the same taxi; they&#39;d probably keep bantering all the way to infinity. That&#39;s exactly the kind of energy Deadpool and Wolverine bring! 🎬😂<br><br>Positive Aspects 🌟🎉<br><br>- <b>*Humor and Comedy:*</b> Deadpool&#39;s endless jokes paired with Wolverine&#39;s silent but impactful presence will have the audience in stitches. This film promises a laughter-filled adventure.<br>- <b>*Action:*</b> Wolverine’s intense action scenes combined with Deadpool’s absurd fighting techniques will deliver an adrenaline rush on screen.<br><br>Negative Aspects 😒🧐<br><br>- <b>*Constant Jokes:*</b> Deadpool’s non-stop humor might tire some viewers. &quot;Can you be serious for a second, man?&quot; might cross some minds. 😂<br>- <b>*Mixed Tone:*</b> The film’s tone might oscillate between extremely funny and very serious, which could leave some viewers feeling a bit confused.<br><br>Overall Expectations 🎥🍿<br><br>As movie lovers, we&#39;ll watch this film and both laugh and get thrilled by the action. With Deadpool’s humor and Wolverine’s toughness, this movie looks like a visual feast. After watching the trailer, I can confidently say, this movie is a must-watch!<br><br> Conclusion 🎬🎉<br><br>In conclusion, &quot;Deadpool and Wolverine: Together&quot; promises to be a total package of fun and action. We’ll laugh, we’ll be thrilled, and we’ll have a great time. Let’s wait and see if it meets our expectations. Looking forward to your comments! 🎬😂"

@muhammadfaisal5Y5,2024-07-03T01:24:14Z,2024-07-03T01:36:10Z,2,"What if this Wolverine went back in time like in DOFP but sided with Magneto instead? This may have resulted in the end of mutant kind in the future and a new timeline in which mutants have dominance over nonmutants with Magneto as the ruler. Consequently, Logan has let down his entire world. Things change for the worst and he becomes a loner. Maybe the nonmutants develop Sentinels either way and mutants get exterminated in both timelines or maybe Logan grows distant because of his conflict with Eric. If nonmutants won again then they clearly let Logan go."

If you turn the volume all the way up as soon as the trailer starts you can hear someone say “One of the Avengers just walked in here” and that lines up because Wade just approaches Logan, and he sees the suit and automatically thought it was Wanda Wilson hence why he said Lady, he probably thought “She” was tryna recruit him to the Avengers."

@VigilanteVegan,2024-06-11T00:55:54Z,2024-06-11T00:55:54Z,0,"Maybe I’m in the minority here, but I’ll say it. Just because Sony, Fox, and Disney are three separate movie studios, does NOT mean the in-story explanation has to be that the characters in the respective three are in their own distinct universe. <br><br>Case in point, I thought the post-credit Venom scene in No Way Home was unnecessary, as there’s no reason for Sony to put themselves in that hole rather than have the implication that Tom Holland’s Spider-man is somewhere out there in that world, just offscreen &amp; not referenced.  <br><br>That being said, just because MCU acquired the rights to Deadpool, does NOT mean there needs to be in-story explanation of him traveling from Fox-verse to Marvel-verse and bringing Wolverine with him through a portal. I’m all for him referencing it breaking the fourth wall, but actually doing it as a major part of the plot is another story. <br><br>The most grounded way of doing it is to imply the X-men, Deadpool, and Wolverine have been in the same world alongside other Marvel characters all along. Just because past X-men instalments didn’t reference them before, that’s perfectly fine. <br><br>The idea of characters switching universes because they change movie studios is absurd and unnecessary. The early Jason movies were distributed by Paramount. Then it switched to New Line Cinema. They never showed Jason hopping into a New Line portal so he could fight Freddy Krueger. 😂<br><br>I’m tired of multiverse stories. They’re great every vicennium as a nostalgic treat, but as a plot device for every other movie, they must go. They make the writer’s job very easy because they’re are infinite possibilities. There are no real threats and stake because a character can hop on over to Fox-verse and nab an alternate version of someone who just died. Iron Man’s death has no meaning really since they can nab a new one over in Sony-verse who happens to look like Tom Cruise. Nothing matters. <br><br>Now, compare to a story like in “The Batman” which has a grounded story without portals and potions to fill a 3-hour runtime where real things are at stake. When people die they die. These stories are harder to write. As I said, the multiverse can be fun, but it needs to go as a plot device. Ever since No Way Home, it’s being used too much."

He was forced to kill all the ex-men by Professor X&#39;s sister. The one who said boys are so silly. I know where they are going with this one. Disney is pulling out the darkest one to save them. It is very dark.

Now after all that they have them broken up in the new film so they can just focus on the guys??? ugh no thanks that is bull 💩

@WYJAFAK2,2024-05-30T13:57:32Z,2024-05-30T13:57:32Z,1,Glad we get one last (?) watch of Hugh Jackman as prime Wolverine. Hopefully there’s more action sequences with him involving him stabbing and getting stabbed as I’ve never felt there was a scene in the franchise that was dedicated to just him going crazy killing people. Apocalypse wasn’t violent enough and closest thing I liked was Logan vs X24 outside the house but that was against an old Logan.

@jteach9124,2024-05-21T15:57:35Z,2024-05-21T15:57:35Z,1,Is this trailer foreal? Marvel has devolved into a disaster of  poor quality writing and untalented producers and directors. Main characters cursing each other out and shamefully ending the trailer scene about main character taking drugs cocaine. What is going on with marve?. Since Endgame it has been one tomato can after the other.

But I know there was a Logan film about 5 years back. How did that end? Because I thought that wolverine was retired so I&#39;m kind of surprised by it. But at the same time I&#39;m up for Deadpool 3. I would love to see this movie in theaters. I&#39;m looking forward to it. Just a little confused cuz the continuity is gone all over the place with this stuff

@thunderrain922,2024-05-16T14:57:26Z,2024-05-16T14:57:26Z,4,FINALLY: The Wolverine we always wanted! At least from the trailer. All these years and being that Hugh    is the perfect actor for Wolverine. They never presented him in true form. To paraphrase; They have always &quot;whisky d*ked&quot; the use of his claws in every film! No real grit. Hoping this movie changes that. We need more Wolverine movies Hugh. The ones where Wolverine isn&#39;t held back from hacking off a villan&#39;s limb in a movie.

Hugh Jackman considered Ryan Reynold&#39;s offer, and decided to do it because he knew it would be an action/comedy - something he has not really done before. So he called up Ryan and said &quot;I am in.&quot;  Pretty cool to get him back one more time at age 55 to play the role one more time."

Give it up for Hugh, the man is 55-years-old and still looks ridiculously amazing as Wolverine. I will gladly watch Ryan Reynolds subvert every possible film rating and studio notes, for however long he wants to play Deadpool. Given the tech these days, he could easily do it for another 20 - 30 years, and I&#39;d have no problem with that. Then again, he seems to be the only one who <b>gets comic fans,</b> and he&#39;d be my Board Vote to lead a studio any day. He&#39;s proven he can do it. Take my money, Ryan, any day, it&#39;s always entertaining, and that&#39;s all we want."

@ariel_shmilovich,2024-04-28T18:17:04Z,2024-04-28T18:17:04Z,2,My hypothesis is that the deadpool &amp; wolverine movie starts the old men logen comic plot and takes place before the logan movie. (prequel)<br>When they say Logan let his whole world down it&#39;s because he failed to kill Doctor X in his seizures that killed most of the x man.<br>And apparently everything takes place in a parallel universe to the 616 universe.

@mrjack8849,2024-04-26T18:57:17Z,2024-04-26T18:57:17Z,1,"This movie serves as the official entrance of all Fox characters to the MCU. I fully expect to see several other cameos of other Fox Marvel characters in the Void. Ioan Gruffudd as Mr. Fantastic, Chris Evans as Johnny Storm, any X-Men actor (many already shown in this trailer), Daredevil, Elektra, Cable (Josh Brolin interacting with Loki would be good with his same voice as Thanos), anybody...Cassandra Nova was pruned in the Fox Universe and sends Deadpool and Wolverine into other universes to obtain items that would allow her to either travel between universes or challenge Loki."

@shaunbang,2024-04-26T10:46:41Z,2024-04-26T10:46:41Z,0,I have a feeling they’re using Antman and Dr. Strange aspects in this film to absolutely rip into their recent films. Nova is clearly using Antmans dead body as her fortress and we see the Strange portal at the end so I can only assume Ryan Reynolds is going completely bash those two films for failing to make the timeline/variant/multiverse films we fans expected.

From what I gage this is a wolverine we&#39;ve never met who&#39;s been living in the MCU but failed and hid in shadows for ages or something. If they&#39;re going into Dr. Strange&#39;s or Wong&#39;s portal at the end, I doubt whatever the plot is will be covered entirely in just this film."

@userman4ik,2024-04-25T15:50:21Z,2024-04-25T15:50:21Z,0,"&quot;Do You Want to Build a Snowman&quot; is a slang term used to refer to a sexual act that involves three or more participants. The term originated from the popular Disney movie &quot;Frozen,&quot; where one of the main characters, Anna, sings a song with the same title. However, the meaning of the term has nothing to do with the movie and is instead a vulgar reference to a specific sexual position."

@haplo_,2024-04-25T14:05:13Z,2024-04-25T14:05:13Z,0,We&#39;ve already seen the ultimate version of this movie. It&#39;s called Logan from 2017. I don&#39;t want to see Deadpool cosplaying as X-23. And a weak-sauce looking villain. Could have at least tried and give us Tilda Swinton in the role and not some girl who sounds like she&#39;s still in college.

Also it is always one scene. We never see him at bar again. He shows up at some random bar like it is his reason for living then he never goes there till a new movie. WHY?"

However (Spoilers)  I would say Xmen97 is directly leading up to this on Wolverines part, due to the convenient timing of the series that will finish not long before D&amp;W is out, the cartoon costume, and the fact Pool has hinted at an act3 flashback which makes me think we won&#39;t need one because we will have allready saw it. Now with Bastion ensuring a war between humans and mutants, the build up for the new guy who clearly could go nuclear, effectively combining in leaving the world in a wasteland for the Victor&#39;s (mutants) antman potentially either tried taking on a giant sentinel or became a giant sentinel hence his corpse (Pretty sure pym was mentioned by beast). Magnetos goons all there potentially because they were secure in prison during the war etc. Basically I&#39;m worried they will be wiping out the xmen97 crew :( leaving only wolverine who&#39;s mutation will likely stop him being transformed by Bastion ...."

@WednesdayAddams-X,2024-04-25T00:12:07Z,2024-04-25T00:38:19Z,1,"OK so here are my speculations. Based on both trailers, we see Deadpool approaching a Wolverine dressed up as &quot;patch&quot; in the first trailer, and then in this one we see him approaching Wolverine in a bar (possibly for the first time) so I&#39;m thinking that at least 2 different Wolverines (Variants) confirmed. The TVA recruits Deadpool because of his healing factor and his fighting skills because they are AFRAID of approaching any Wolverine variants to capture them (for whatever reason) so they need Deadpool&#39;s help with that because he&#39;s the only one who can do it (fight a Wolverine variant and survive), now I&#39;m expecting that the TVA tricks Deadpool because we see him killing TVA agents in the trailer so they either lie to him about why they want these Wolverine variants captured/pruned, or he just discovers something he doesn&#39;t like right after he succeeds in capturing Wolverine because we see him lying on the ground so either way Deadpool ends up turning against them but he and this Wolverine get pruned as well and get sent to the Void at the end of time (where we see the 20th century fox logo) because we also see Alioth (the cloudy looking creature) in the trailer which we saw for the first time in the LOKI series. Now we also hear Deadpool saying (&quot;I&#39;m about to lose everything that I ever cared about&quot; and &quot;I don&#39;t know anything about saving worlds&quot;) and I did say earlier that he discovers something he doesn&#39;t like so that could be that he discovers that the TVA wants to prune/erase his reality (Deadpool&#39;s reality)!! So that means Vanessa, Dopinder, Al, and all the others that we see in the trailer will be gone forever and it&#39;s possibly because in his last movie Deadpool went back in time to save Vanessa (which is something that he&#39;s not supposed to do based on how the TVA works) so Deadpool starts to try and convince Wolverine to help him save his world (giving him a chance for redemption for failing to save his own) as well as finding a way to get out of the void and back to the TVA to stop them in time. I don&#39;t know if the Dr. Strange portal has anything to do with getting them out or not but they will be encountering lots of characters along the way possibly other variants. But the real villain here is the TVA. At least that&#39;s what I think, but I could be wrong though. Either way I think at least some of it is real based on what the trailer shows. At least some of it makes sense. Don&#39;t you agree?"

@Adeelzia007,2024-04-24T20:43:09Z,2024-04-24T20:43:09Z,0,Let me tell you what I think is going to happen remember Charls and Magneto went to logan asking for help and he said &quot;Get the f*ck out of here&quot; while sitting in a bar which led to the death of all of the X-man and maybe humans! (his World) &quot;Not him helping them&quot; This is that Logan so now we can see him sitting in a bar again where he&#39;s not welcome anymore and Deadpool comes to him. Thats why TVA accuse him of letting down his world because he didn&#39;t help them. So that&#39;s how this is his fault and now may be Deadpool convince him to help him not letting down other worlds and redeem himself this is why we can even see Deadpool fighting TVA to save him and guess what this is the reason we are hearing again and again in the trailer &quot;Get the F*ck out of here&quot;.
@CoreyCgamerboy,2024-04-24T20:38:57Z,2024-04-24T20:38:57Z,2,Apparently Nicholas cage is coming to the movie not sure coming back as ghost rider again I hope it’s true

@jeanharoldmagnait8928,2024-04-23T14:53:15Z,2024-04-23T14:53:15Z,1,I always get a feeling that they are only showing like half of the movie on this trailer. I also feel like the &quot;3rd act&quot; is what really gonna establish the arrival of the X-Men in the MCU. It is also kinda poetic that the ones who are gonna greet them is from the first live action X-Men (Hugh Jackman/Wolverine) and the last X-Men/trainee on screen (Ryan Reynolds/Deapool).

They did a terrible job introducing Cassandra Nova, who is supposed to be Professor X&#39;s evil twin sister in an alternate universe so she&#39;s a very powerful, formidable supervillain. People need to remember that the hero is only as good as his villain.  I have no doubt this movie is going to be epic because of the cast and crew involved but  this trailer looked like it was edited by a kid from Fiverr."

Just like the comic books when we were kids, you could pick up whatever Spider man, X men, Wolverine/Hulk or what ever comic and it was just a story in time. You didn&#39;t have to already read all the other comics. You could just as easily make Iron Man movie that didn&#39;t have anything to do with the main universe like it has been since 2008 Iron Man 1. Give us the golden age again..."

@phillconklin382,2024-04-22T22:00:44Z,2024-04-22T22:00:44Z,0,Looks good. I hope everyone gives it a chance. For the last few years I no longer universally support Marvel but when something looks good I definitely want to send the message that you are going in a good direction. Equally not seeing a movie is a message that no I do not think this is a good direction. Sadly with a few exceptions Marvel has lossed the fans in an attempt to modernize things. But I did quite enjoy Guardians of the Galaxy 3 and this looks very impressive and a great time.

Like, prevented Quicksilver&#39;s death, the Avengers didn&#39;t lose to Thanos the 1st time so that means Iron Man &amp; Black Widow didn&#39;t die 5 years later &amp; Cap never went back in time &amp; stayed in the past, but still passed the mantle to Falcon, stopped Star-Lord from making that idiot reckless decision of attacking Thanos while his gauntlet was being taken off, prevented Yondu&#39;s death, changed the actor of T&#39;Challa so that means he&#39;s still very much alive, make Hank &amp; Janet younger &amp; Hank&#39;s Yellowjacket &amp; Janet is still Wasp while Scott is still Ant-Man, &amp; Hank &amp; Janet are both Avengers, prevented Photon being trapped in another universe, save Scarlet Witch from being crushed, make Doctor Strange the Sorcerer Supreme again, prevented Spider-Man&#39;s identity to be exposed which would prevent Aunt May&#39;s death, stopped Ikaris from killing Ajak, saved Elektra from being crushed, prevented Luke Cage from going a dark path, stopping Hellcat from crossing the line, changing Hawkeye&#39;s life story so that he&#39;s married to Bobbi Morse/Mockingbird, stopping Agent 13 from going down a dark path, &amp; prevented Maria Hills&#39; death."

God is the one who created this great universe and has complete control over it. And the greatest loss that a person loses in this life is that he lives while he does not know God who created him, knowing the Messenger of Muhammad, the last of the messengers, and the Islamic religion, the last of the heavenly religions.  The great intelligence, before you believe in something or not, is to read it, study it, and understand it well, and then you have the choice to believe in it or not. I advise you on this now before you do not have time to do that."

Keep silly characters silly, keep serious characters serious, and we will be fine moving forward, it’s not hard."

What it&#39;s missing so far is the Adamantium blades and dual swords doing more than poking actions, i want to see bits missing off the maniacs mauled by the duo. <br>DON&#39;T screw this franchise up marvel/disney, i&#39;m already sick of the bait n switches, MASSIVE jump off a cliff in quality/writing/overarching-plot and the forced introduction of failed-run characters in famous/popular characters&#39; movies/shows/storylines for that new person to steal all the limelight and kill-steal the final encounter. <br><br>NO LAST MINUTE ROSTER SWAPS in the final act."

I&#39;ll only give it a shot cause it feels at least semi competent compared to the last 2 of 3 years of Marvels track record. Its part of Deadpools character to make cringey jokes and comments anyways. Granted, him calling himself &quot;Marvel Jesus&quot; shows that Marvel knows they&#39;ve sucked these last few years, so kinda not a look already. But eh, is what marvel is now, half written plot mixed with Characters cracking a one liner ever minute. I miss the level the Avengers felt, that&#39;s what a superhero movie should feel like."

Has to be better than that apocalypse garbage singer did. On another note, bad idea to make it rated R. All the cussing is monotonous and gratuitous and adds nothing of value to the story. First time felt fresh, this time just reaffirms Deadpool as a one trick pony, and it&#39;s not a hell of a trick."

Absolutely perfect. It doesn&#39;t feel like a single beat of comedy is missed, and seeing Jackman and Reynolds together like this is absolutely perfect.<br>2.) I love the design for Logan&#39;s claws. I&#39;m going to keep commenting on them. That partial dull blade tip, and the deeper shade of silver is just epic. And it looks like Jackman has barely stepped away from the role of Wolverine. You can take the Jackman away from the animal, but you can&#39;t take the animal away from the Jackman, and I can already see myself dying of laughter when this comes out."

The brightness seems to be unnecessarily low. The action scenes look choppy. It looks like it was shot on a DSLR or something? Something looks very odd over here and not in a good way. I was so excited for this movie but now it seems even the story is a generic buddy film. Wolverine&#39;s motivations are literally explained to you in the trailer lmao 😭 what the hell is this? The CGI is also extremely distracting.

Deadpool is my brother&#39;s biggest number 1 idol in Marvel history since l&#39;ve been showing him the very first film. He wants to have a Deadpool theme for his 11th birthday party. He also wants to dress up as Deadpool with a Hello Kitty backpack and maybe some blue crocks when we go to the theaters. And he also wants to be Deadpool for Halloween this year. And to me, The Wolverine has been my favorite Marvel super hero character since 2009. Wolverine is the best there is at what he does. But what he does best, isn&#39;t very nice and Deadpool is a merch with a mouth that never shuts up while he is awake."

@Palmieres,2024-04-22T14:18:36Z,2024-04-22T14:18:36Z,0,"Okay. I collected comics for a long time. I never thought the movie adaptations were even close to decent. But Hugh Jackman has just become Wolverine for me right now. His age has been a benefit to this portrayal, because Wolverine is <i>old</i> , and while Jackman isn&#39;t as old, this right here is what Wolverine is supposed to look like. Now, I loved the character in &quot;Logan&quot;, but that is not the same &quot;golden age of the 90s&quot; character, that&#39;s someone different, made difference by even more time and trauma. That&#39;s a little diamond of a movie in the middle of mediocrity.<br>But this guy right here... this is just right."

@iamvaishere,2024-04-22T14:18:31Z,2024-04-22T14:18:31Z,14,Hugh Jackman is such a great actor and he has a solid screen presence. Even after so many years he&#39;s still in his Wolverine character playing so well and we can see it on screen. I can say it takes years of practice to portray a character so good that it made the  audiences believe that he is the actual Wolverine and not the character. Kudos to the actor.

It sucks because I used to be a big fan of the series and the actors in birthday results resorted to lowbrow scraping the bottom of the barrel tactics it&#39;s overcompensate for trash content. And it sucks because all the people who are just being introduced to comics in marvel are going to think this is what the Deadpool character is about and it&#39;s not. Is pansexual God bless me cursing murdering street is Ryan Reynolds in the director&#39;s creation and not Deadpool the actual comic character Disney marvel to actually shut this thing down and create a comic book authentic version of deadpool and to bring Hugh Jackman out of his wolverine retirement for this disgraceful. I would have ended this with the IMO except for the fact I&#39;m telling the truth.
