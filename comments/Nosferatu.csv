@jaytaylor5967,2025-03-23T01:12:17Z,2025-03-23T01:12:17Z,0,"This movie disappointing a strange vampire that you never see his teeth. There&#39;s not much blood. The bloodiest part is during the part where the gross guide bites. The pigeons Head off, which was quite disturbing.<br>The best part to me was when he juiced the children and threw them down like Empty juice boxes.<br> The worst part was the ending. And also, when the vampire was humping the guy while he was sucking his blood, which was really stuvisually. The movie was okay. It had some well filmed parts.  I was expecting something shocking, something adult. More adult than what we got something that your children could never see. Other than the fact, there&#39;s a male doing full frontal nudity, which I could have done without?  I didn&#39;t need to see Vampire penis. So so compared to the North man, this movie is garbage.<br> And the ending is so absolutely stupid. Oh I just couldn&#39;t pull myself away from you because you&#39;re just so beautiful. I&#39;m gonna kill myself.  Because I&#39;m so in love with you. I&#39;m not gonna leave the Sun&#39;s coming up, but I&#39;m too stupid to leave and then her she&#39;s so stupid. I&#39;m gonna let him s*** m* dry because I am so stupid. It seemed like there was 20 minutes missing from the movie. At the end, there was no build up to the ending. There was no climax. There was no payoff. No satisfaction. All I got was the horrible ending and that vampire looked so stupid. Where&#39;s his teeth at? What does he bite people with? What vampire movie doesn&#39;t show the vampire&#39;s teeth.  So<br> Strange very odd, very disappointing. Dracula , nineteen seventy nine was better than this"

@timvoridis1120,2025-03-18T05:11:55Z,2025-03-18T21:38:10Z,0,"I have just finished watching &#39;Nosferatu&#39; and I truly have to say that Nicholas Hoult and Emma Corrin are killing it - they are superb and they should have been nominated at least for a BAFTA or an Academy Award. The cinematography, costumes, music and direction are excellent. The first half is way better and more &#39;ethereal&#39; in a gothic horror way than the 2nd half, which is kind of a mess with elements from &#39;The exorcist&#39;, too much drama and annoying scenes. Lilly Rose Depp is good but overacting in many scenes and Johnson is miscast and boring in his role. Skarsgard, Dafoe and Ineson are entertaining, but the whole film is uneven; nevertheless, the 4K blu ray version must be a knockout."

@Gamingawesomeness121,2025-03-12T22:54:47Z,2025-03-13T01:17:20Z,0,"Well I guess it’s time i watched it. though i am not a fan of the director. But Looks interesting indeed, i will edit this comment after watching the film.<br><br>Edit: well it’s a Robert Eggers movie… not really scary,over use of music, long unnecessary shots of people looking at things or looking for things, overacting and over playing the drama and feelings any conversation or situation is trying to portray. But awesome imagery, great use of blood and horror when it is shown, great portrayal of people going mad or being mad when it isn’t overreacting and justified for the characters with the appropriate scenes and good dialogue despite the overselling the drama. It took me half the movie to start caring and being interested i the events and what would happen but when it dis i found myself enjoying watching them unfold. Overall not bad honestly, i liked it. though i played it on 1.25x speed lol his films are longer than they should be imo. <br>Cant say i can rewatch it (at least not at its intended pace) but definitely better than the light house and maybe more enjoyable than the witch for me probably because this one is treated more like a monster movie. <br>I’d give it a 7 out of 10."

I have been a horror fan for a long time, and I kind of got scared of watching this because I saw so much backlash online towards it. &quot;Boring, not good compared to the 90s Dracula etc.&quot; Well, I can truly say this was a spectacular film, truly a gothic masterpiece with excellent writing, directing, cinematography and acting. So if you are in doubt whether to watch it or not, please do. Also,  never have I seen an actor disappear to a role like Bill Skarsgård did, you really can&#39;t tell it&#39;s him in anyway. The movie is fantastic and it&#39;s going to be a cult classic!"

@aurelnicolaeion3764,2025-02-25T20:47:43Z,2025-02-25T20:53:06Z,1,"So manny things unexplained, let me break one for you guys ! You remember jn the beginning of the movie when those gipsy guys stick theirs object in the heart of the dead??! Those are called “Strigoi” in romanian culture or in english Strygwyr  and there is no joke about them! <br>My mothet told me before like 100 years ago there weren’t manny people in the village like now, and sometimes when the decesead person died in a manner that not founded peace he would terrorised the family after death ! Like haunting them smashing plates all kinds of evil sounds and so on! My mother told me my grandfather used to gather with the community and if they suspected a dead beeing a “Strigoi” would open the grave ( wich is totally ilegal these days) and most of the times they would found the dead ( Strigoi) on a side 😳 that meaning he left the grave during night to haunt the family. I know sounds stupid but these folk stories are real ! The they would take a long stick with a metal in the head and STAB THEM IN THE HEART ! In order to make sure they die , same like in the movie .<br>My mother comes from Craiova , wich is the region who created this mythical stories, and even now when I am 32 when she speaking about these shivers on my skin ! It is incredible"

This movie makes you think and it&#39;s creepy gothic horror at its best. I found it very disturbing in parts the production and sets are fantastic. The photography and filming does make it feel very similar to the old silent film. I really liked the costumes too deserves a few Oscars. I wonder if they filmed in locations from the original silent movie. ❤

BUT there was one thing that at some moment hit me like a shovel! Do you know Litani til Satan by Gorgoroth? Their interpretation of the poem by Charles Baudelaire? Count Nosferatu slowly articulating every word was hilariously reminding me of Gaahl slowly dragging out every little word during their whole version of the poem. It was kind of amusing because my brain was chanting &quot;Og du den vakre engel/ Vis oss dei lære/ Av gud og lagnad/ Fratatt makt og ære...&quot; every time Nosferatu spoke 😂😂"

The two older actors and Hoult were decent and The vampire. But rest was horrible. It&#39;s definitely his worst movie. Should of got a good actress for the lead.

Do yourself a favor and watch Bram Stoker&#39;s Dracula instead.

@СергейАкимов-ъ9р,2025-02-10T07:50:50Z,2025-02-10T07:50:50Z,0,"Надо всегда говорить ПРЯМО. ВСЁ ИСКУССТВО: КИНО, ТЕАТР, МУЗЫКА, КНИГИ, ПОЭЗИЯ, имеет ИСКЛЮЧИТЕЛЬНО ДВА ГЛОБАЛЬНЫХ СМЫСЛА, либо служит ПРОСЛАВЛЕНИЮ БОЖЬЕГО СЛОВА, либо дьяволу. Служить БОЖЬЕМУ СЛОВУ это значит, каждым КАДРОМ, РЕПЛИКОЙ, КУПЛЕТОМ и т.п. &quot;ПРИВОДИТЬ&quot; НАС, ЗРИТЕЛЕЙ, СЛУШАТЕЛЕЙ к ПОКАЯНИЮ, СПАСЕНИЮ ДУШИ, и соответственно наоборот, максимально удалять от него. <br><br>МЕРЗКОЕ сатанинское КИНО. ДЬЯВОЛЬСКАЯ НАСМЕШКА, а ПОЧЕМУ надо понимать следующее. НО СНАЧАЛА. Любое НЕ УПОМИНАНИЕ(где бы то ни было) об Отце нашем небесном, подарившим для наших душ жизнь вечную, которая может испытывать такую блаженственную радость, но мы сами не хотим этого своей греховной жизнью, И также любое УПОМИНАНИЕ О БОГЕ в фильме ВСУЕ(что значит обращения к Богу без молитвы и благовейного состояния), И СЛОВА ЛЮБОВЬ, потому что Бог есть Любовь, ВСЁ ЭТО обычное мелкопакостное БОГОХУЛЬСТВО(ХУЛА на ДУХА СВЯТОГО), самый страшный грех если прельститься. НО БОГА ОБИДЕТЬ НЕ ВОЗМОЖНО ОН БЕССТРАСТЕН, А вот ХУЛА ЕГО это БОЛЬШОЙ ГРЕХ. А ГРЕХ это РАНА которую человек наносит прежде всего сам СВОЕЙ ДУШЕ. РАНА которая ОТКРЫВАЕТ ДУШУ ДЛЯ ДЕМОНОВ мучителей, БЕСОВ ПОРОЧНЫХ СТРАСТЕЙ, слуг дьявола. Сам же ФИЛЬМ на самом деле и прежде всего НАМЕРЕННО «РАЗЖИГАЕТ», но В ДУШАХ самих ЗРИТЕЛЕЙ, действие множества СТРАШНЫХ ПОРОЧНЫХ СТРАСТЕЙ, ну например таких ЛУКАВСТВО(ЗЛОСТЬ), ГОРДЫНЯ, ТЩЕСЛАВИЕ(ПАГУБНАЯ СТРАСТЬ К ЛЮДСКОЙ СЛАВЕ), ЗАВИСТЬ, ЧЕЛОВЕКОУГОДИЕ, ГНЕВ, НЕНАВИСТЬ, МЕСТЬ, СРЕБРОЛЮБИЕ(ПАГУБНАЯ СТРАСТЬ К ДЕНЬГАМ), ЛЮБОСТЯЖАНИЕ, НЕМОЩЬ, КУРЕНИЕ, ПОХОТЬ, БЛУД, СТРАХ, И пагубную СТРАСТЬ К всякой БЕСОВЩИНЕ. И ВОТ так, ОГРОМНОЕ БОЛЬШИНСТВО ЛЮДЕЙ(не понимают), и ВОЛЬНО ИЛИ НЕВОЛЬНО СОГРЕШАЮТ(невольно значит что, грех только у себя в уме, под действием той или иной порочной страсти, является таким же грехом), И ДЬЯВОЛ «ВВОДИТ» В ДУШУ человека ДЕМОНОВ МУЧИТЕЛЕЙ разных ПОРОЧНЫХ СТРАСТЕЙ. Ну А «ОБЩЕНИЕ» человека в жизни С любым ДЕМОНОМ, «ПРИВЕДЁТ» рано или поздно только к одному, или К ПСИХИЧЕСКОМУ РАССТРОЙСТВУ, или УБИЙСТВУ, или САМОУБИЙСТВУ. И к АДУ для ДУШИ после физической СМЕРТИ тела. И что ещё имеет смысл в этом кино. Образно показано (и опять же в виде насмешки, потому что мало зрителей к сожалению понимает что реально происходит в фильме) какого дьявольского демона мучителя, «основные» демоны мучители лукавства (тех которых называют чертями, отпавшие от дьявола, а есть ещё и другого типа) не смогут «подчинить» себе, а значит и победить дьявола. Но сатана как всегда лжёт. Этот демон уже «подчинён» этими вольными каменщиками. Да и как выглядит этот сатанинский демон в своём «человеческом» виде показано в этом фильме. И вот как БЫЛО БЫ ХОРОШО, ЧТОБЫ КАЖДЫЙ зритель ПОНИМАЛ это. НО ЭТО всё очень «глубокие» моменты, ПОНЯТЬ которые МОЖНО будет ТОЛЬКО ЧИТАЯ, И ГЛАВНОЕ, ИЗУЧАЯ КНИГУ ЖИЗНИ, СВЯТОЕ ЕВАНГЕЛИЕ.<br><br>Да и ПОРОЧНЫЕ СТРАСТИ это ГОРДЫНЯ, ТЩЕСЛАВИЕ, ЛУКАВСТВО, СЕБЯЛЮБИЕ, ТРУСОСТЬ, ЧЕЛОВЕКОУГОДИЕ, ЗАВИСТЬ, ЖАДНОСТЬ, ОСУЖДЕНИЕ, АЛЧНОСТЬ, СКУПОСТЬ, СРЕБРОЛЮБИЕ, ЛИЦЕМЕРИЕ, УНЫНИЕ, ЧРЕВОУГОДИЕ, ГНЕВ, РЕВНОСТЬ, ВОРОВСТВО, РАЗДРАЖЕНИЕ, ВЛАСТОЛЮБИЕ, ПОХОТЬ, ЛЮБОПЫТСТВО, ПЬЯНСТВО, КУРЕНИЕ, ПРЕЛЮБОДЕЯНИЕ, ОБИДЧИВОСТЬ, ЗАСТЕНЧИВОСТЬ, ХИТРОСТЬ, РАССЕЯННОСТЬ и т.д. и т.п. И у КАЖДОГО ЧЕЛОВЕКА своя(СТРАСТЬ), так сказать, ЛИЧНАЯ. И ЭТО всё БОЛЕЗНИ, но БОЛЕЗНИ ДУХОВНОГО ПЛАНА.<br><br>А ПОЧЕМУ мы ВСЕ БОЛЬНЫ. После ГРЕХОПАДЕНИЯ АДАМА и ЕВЫ они были ИЗГНАНЫ ИЗ РАЯ. ДО грехопадения они ЖИЛИ В РАЮ подобно АНГЕЛАМ. После, БОГ одел их в «одежды» что значит в тела, и ДАЛ ЗАПОВЕДЬ «ПЛОДИТЕСЬ и РАЗМНОЖАЙТЕСЬ» и заселяйте Землю. НО для размножения, В ПОЛОВЫЕ ОТНОШЕНИЯ ПРИХОДИЛОСЬ ВСТУПАТЬ БРАТУ С СЕСТРОЙ. И ЭТО было вызвано необходимостью а НЕ ПОХОТЬЮ. И ВОТ ПОЧЕМУ КАЖДЫЙ рождающийся ребёнок уже ГРЕШЕН.  Только не физическое(физическое если вызвано похотью, между родными братьями и сёстрами), а так называемое ПЕРВОРОДНОЕ (ДУХОВНОЕ , ПРИЧИНА которого ГРЕХОПАДЕНИЕ) ПОВРЕЖДЕНИЕ(ГРЕХ, ПОРОЧНАЯ СТРАСТЬ) НА КАЖДОМ человеке при рождении. И У КАЖДОГО человека своя СОБСТВЕННАЯ СТРАСТЬ. И ЭТО БОЛЕЗНЬ, но БОЛЕЗНЬ прежде всего ДУХОВНОГО ПЛАНА.  И именно ПОРОЧНЫЕ СТРАСТИ людей являются ПРИЧИНОЙ ВСЕХ БЕД, СТРАДАНИЙ, и РАЗРУШИТЕЛЬНЫХ ДЕЙСТВИЙ на Земле. А вот условия ОСВОБОЖДЕНИЯ ОТ этого ПЕРВОРОДНОГО ГРЕХА(ПОВРЕЖДЕНИЯ, СТРАСТИ) как раз и ЗАПИСАНЫ в КНИГЕ ЖИЗНИ, СВЯТОМ ЕВАНГЕЛИЕ. НО СНАЧАЛА , чтобы донести их людям,  сам СЫН, БОГ СЛОВО ВОЧЕЛОВЕЧИЛСЯ(ИИСУС ХРИСТОС, имя ИИСУС означает СПАСИТЕЛЬ). А ЕГО за это РАСПЯЛИ. Но ОСТАЛОСЬ СВЯТОЕ ЕВАНГЕЛИЕ. Вот ЭТО и есть БОЖЕСТВЕННЫЕ УСЛОВИЯ , во первых ИЗБАВЛЕНИЯ ОТ ПЕРВОРОДНОГО ГРЕХА(а правильней сказать от ПОВРЕЖДЕНИЯ), И во вторых ДЛЯ СПАСЕНИЯ ДУШИ человеческой, ПОЛУЧЕНИЯ ЖИЗНИ ВЕЧНОЙ для ДУШИ, ПОСЛЕ физической СМЕРТИ тела , В ЦАРСТВИЕ НЕБЕСНОМ.<br><br>И поэтому ИСТИННАЯ ВЕРА В БОГА, в первую очередь ЗАКЛЮЧАЕТСЯ В «БОРЬБЕ» каждого ЧЕЛОВЕКА, ПРИ ЗЕМНОЙ ЖИЗНИ, С своими собственными ПОРОЧНЫМИ СТРАСТЯМИ, И только ТАК можно получить СПАСЕНИЕ для своей ДУШИ.<br><br>А ЧТОБЫ  &quot;ПРИЙТИ&quot; к БОГУ или ПОЗНАТЬ БОГА необходимо ПОКАЯНИЕ.  <br><br>Ну А для того ЧТОБЫ ПОНЯТЬ ВСЁ что ЗАПИСАНО выше, И для ИСКРЕННЕГО ХРИСТИАНСКОГО ПОКАЯНИЯ, которое необходимо УСПЕТЬ(потому что ВРЕМЕНИ у каждого человека его земной жизни осталось очень МАЛО, придёт СМЕРТЬ, И ВСЁ )СДЕЛАТЬ ПРИ ЗЕМНОЙ ЖИЗНИ ЧЕЛОВЕКА, ПЕРВЫМ &quot;шагом&quot; будет (и как об этом уже упоминалось выше) ЧТЕНИЕ и ГЛАВНОЕ, ИЗУЧЕНИЕ КНИГИ ЖИЗНИ, СВЯЩЕННОГО ПИСАНИЯ НОВЫЙ ЗАВЕТ. ✋🏻"

I was hesitant in watching this new version due that I’ve been eternally in love with Mr. Coppola’s master piece; however, this adaptation, with some minor issues, was spectacular. Pleased me to the core the amount of quality-acting, even from Miss Deep. The movie has the hability to pin you to the chair, make you scream and the history could even touch you deeply. Very good photography and spectacular sound. It seems as if talent is turning his face to us again, those are good news."

First she is &quot;I swear.&quot; and then later she hates her first friend and prefers to kill him and die herself to save the people who tie her down and don&#39;t listen to her. I mentally checked out when the two spoke in front of the window. To be fair, the vampire was a mess as well - &quot;we cant steal her&quot;  &quot;ill kill everyone if you dont though&quot; RIP"

But honestly, I was left pretty disappointed.<br><br>The visuals were undeniably stunning, and Eggers’ attention to detail was great, but it didn’t hold a candle to the eerie, timeless atmosphere of the older films, especially the 1922 version. That movie still stands as one of the scariest and most atmospheric horror films of all time, and this new version just doesn’t compare. With all the talent in the cast—Willem Dafoe, Bill Skarsgård—it’s a shame they couldn’t have made a more gripping experience.<br><br>Lily-Rose Depp as Ellen didn’t work for me either. Her performance felt flat and didn’t carry the emotional weight the role needs. It’s like they had all the right pieces but still couldn’t capture what made the originals so unforgettable. For a 2025 film, I honestly expected something way more impactful. It’s visually beautiful, but as a whole, it missed the mark. I really think they could’ve done better with all the advancements in filmmaking today."

@SergeBernardifromPA,2025-01-25T12:32:54Z,2025-01-25T12:32:54Z,0,Nice photography and visuals but very dull and boring movie. Dracula looked more like Rasputin than Nosferatu... The director should have kept the original look of the vampire because he didn&#39;t look scary but rather weird and more like some kind of zombie than a vampire. Ford Coppola&#39;s Dracula was way much better and even the movie &quot;Last voyage of the Demeter&quot; was better than this one.
@maxfish2301,2025-01-25T10:48:05Z,2025-01-25T10:48:05Z,2,The movie should have ended with someone sticking a gun in Dracula&#39;s mouth and go&#39;s &quot;Hey Dracula suck on this&quot;!!!

Also, you can really feel the atmosphere of the Romantic era everywhere, with all its distinctive features. You&#39;ve got the tormented hero and the girl – of course, she&#39;s got tuberculosis, sleepwalking, and dark circles under her eyes. The intimate interiors and the overall gloomy atmosphere. Caspar David Friedrich seems to be all over the frames, plus there&#39;s this interest in mysticism and legends typical for that period.<br><br>If you’re familiar with the book and have some knowledge of art history and literature, it becomes even more interesting. But if you don’t know much, it might just come off as a &quot;horror with jump scares for girls,&quot; like some people mentioned in other posts.<br><br>Of course, Count Orlok&#39;s character is very infernal, and the acting is incredible. Definitely watch it on the big screen during a late-night show."

The heaviness the counts feet captured with sound effects felt rather like an ogre in a cartoon character . Dracula was portrayed demonic which did not add fitness and class to his title Count. However William Defoe performed beautifully and should have played the count himself.

@dshom,2025-01-21T19:49:39Z,2025-01-21T19:49:39Z,0,If you’re going to see this you need to set your expectations aside. This isn’t a jump-scare slasher movie. This is psychological horror set in a historical setting of 1800s Germany. The way they talk and dress is old school and like opening a time capsule. The movie is a remake of a silent film from the 1920s. If you understand and appreciate that you can enjoy this incredible film for what it is.

@sierrafairbanks7776,2025-01-14T21:25:47Z,2025-01-14T21:25:47Z,0,"Apparently, Nosferatu was so similar to Bram Stoker&#39;s book that his widow sued the creators and won $40,000. Good for her. Also, hearing the story of the family, which was part of the inspiration for Bram Stoker, was disturbing. I think I would rather die than eat the ashes of either of my siblings. 😂"

I wouldn&#39;t say one of the greatest horror films of all time, but certainly within this decade for sure. The performances were great all around. They felt a little too much like performances from a stage play than of film, but I&#39;m pretty sure that was intentional, because the performances in the original were stage play actors. <br><br>I might be in the minority here and I know the bad history of horror films with sequels, but I actually really want to see a sequel. A sequel that&#39;s from Tom&#39;s perspective, and him dealing with the aftermath. How is he holding up? How are the town holding up? How much did Ellen&#39;s sacrifice effect Tom? I would love for a sequel to answer to those questions. It would be realistic and heartbreaking to have the sequel showcase Tom as an overweight, pipe smoking and alcoholic drunk, trying to hide and suppress his shame, his rage and sadness. The plot could be to showcase Tom&#39;s growing obsession to call to Ellen, and how his actions will effect him and the town throughout the film"

One of the main characters was constantly out of breath, scared and pretty much useless to anyone. I was waiting for a lead here. I didn&#39;t feel there was one. I&#39;m really worried about movies like this that get loads of praise because of what I&#39;ve outlined. I just couldn&#39;t connect with this movie. Compare this to Werner Herzogs 70&#39;s effort, or Francis Ford Coppola&#39;s 90&#39;s Dracula. Those movies do a better job of connecting with something in you, I feel."

I’m an absolute fan of all the films, and the original one still stands the test of time. When I first heard Robert Eggers was directing the film, I died, it was the perfect marriage, a match made in Hell. ‘The Witch’ ‘The Lighthouse’ were both exceptional dark and gritty atmospheric masterpieces, this movie did not disappoint, and the cast were all well chosen. And it was great to see Willem Dafoe back in it, playing the part of a backseat hero letting Skarsgard take the wheel as Orlok, representing my favorite all time vampire. There’s been some real lemons this year with films for me, so seeing Nosferatu exceed my wildest expectations, chefs kiss. Thank you Hollywood for letting Eggers get his hands on this slice of German and now American, cinema history. I cannot 5 star this film enough, go see it!"

But this movie is the definition of disappointment , this movie is a rip off dracula (1992) and it’s way worse than that . Nothing in this movie is original and nothing is extraordinary and unique. Honestly i can’t believe robert eggers just made a rip off movie but in his own way and just change the title and the ending. Because the only thing that this movie differs from dracula 1992 is the title and the ending (which in this movie is very bad )"

It just makes perfect sense and an excellent opportunity for him to go all out with his overacting. But Professor Bulwer&#39;s stand-in is a nice twist.

@wtfu812omg,2025-01-05T01:59:33Z,2025-01-05T01:59:33Z,1,"Saw it today in imax. No not just to have my balls rumbled for 2 hours……or maybe 😛. Anyway it was fantastic.lil dramatic wit the acting and Willem Defoe always over the top. I was honestly worried about the fact that Count Orlock had a Stacie but honestly, it made sense considering he was Carpathian nobleman from back in the dark ages, so it wasn’t terrible, and honestly, the rest of them looked phenomenal from the rotting back of his head to his bony hands with elongated fingernails and a subtle but great detail was his nose which was large like somebody from that region but that there was decomposition  that showed where the skulls nasal passage starts but still covered with skin. And his skin was very corpse like without being night of the living dead. It was to show that he was continuing to feed on people to sustain his body as best he could from totally decomposition Ing and becoming what we’ve known in movie law and video games as a Nosferatu vampire which are completely blue and spindly and pointy ears, etc. really something that is emaciated from lack of feeding. The fact that he had to hear and not very much because on the top of his head was next to nothing but enough that he could pull to the side, as if he still had some semblance of a man who was losing his hair, but tried to do a comb over, but then he died and became a vampire so he was stuck with what he had. The back of his head was awesome because it’s like he had been laying in his tomb every night on his dead skull and skin so not much was happening to retain it because of all the pressure and laying on his Back every night in his infernal tomb, and of course, by the middle of the movie you saw quite the reveal from his crypt yet it wasn’t the typical Nosferatu or Bram Stoker is Dracula, where he rises out of the tomb like he’s on an ironing board in a spring, which brings them up. This was so much more which I thought was cool because they didn’t use a whole lot of what they’ve already seen in the past movies and of course you unfortunately got a full view of him because apparently he doesn’t wear clothes when he goes to bed, so it was pretty horrendous, and of course, by the end of the movie, you get a full back shot reveal of what he looks like, and it’s not pretty, but it really abuses the fact that he has a living dead being trying to sustain himself on feeding on blood and oh my God if you see the scenes where he is feeding all I can say is if you watch it in iMac, you’re really gonna hear it and feel it. That’s all I can say I don’t wanna ruin too much but all in all, this was a great movie. I highly recommend it. Yes, it is a bit artsy at times, but it’s also beautiful because much like in vein of the lighthouse in the witch. The attention to the detail of the backgrounds in settings are incredibly beautiful. And if I can also recommend another movie prior to going in to see this one was something that was just released and it’s on YouTube. It is a shot for shot remake of the 1922 Nosferatu movie but in color to a point and with acting and voice and sound starring the one and only Doug Jones, we know from Hellboy and other amazing roles where he has dressed up in full cost him much like Pam’s labyrinth. I literally just watched that one last night because I knew I was going to see Nosferatu 2024 tonight now they’re talking Oscars and that this movie will win one well I probably say yeah I don’t pay attention to that crap too much but this was definitely quite a movie for me having not been to the movie, theaters and years since the first avengers infinity war and I just stopped going to the movies for a very long time not so much due to Covid but just cause there was a lot of shit coming out, but I think this would highly recommend for one to go back to the theatres. 👍👍👍👍👍"

@rgbnights,2025-01-02T19:48:53Z,2025-01-02T19:48:53Z,0,"Nosferatu? We walked out of AMC. It used every used horror movie scenario, like a quiet intro dialog suddenly shocked by a loud blast with a monster face. The timeline included waking up to a weird dream with muddy shoes, a cadaver humping an office worker, a pigeon getting its head bit off, the planks on this hundred-year-old ship being stained with deck waterproofing, a woman with exorcist contortions and screams, set up scenes with a lot of rats, lots of puke, and eating blood and guts, the creepy crypt and fake nail makeup was too clean, the voice of the monster was too fake and much too loud (like Darth Vader). And poor Willem Dafo ! He had to act with its amateur costuming and screenplay. The original 1922 silent German Expressionist vampire film directed by F. W. Murnau from a screenplay by Henrik Galeen was much creepier. Nosferatu 2024 is truly a horror of a movie, I couldn&#39;t wait to get out of there! The kids will love it."

@danielafernandez7484,2025-01-01T18:52:44Z,2025-01-01T18:52:44Z,3,This is such a disappointing movie. It wasn’t good. They just gave him a mustache. And it’s just about a girl who wants to fuck a monster that’s really what it sucked. Do not believe any of the comments that say it was good. It was not a good movie. I walked out.

@TimekillX,2025-01-01T13:45:32Z,2025-01-01T13:45:32Z,2,I noticed the vampire in the movie says humankind instead of mankind.<br><br>This is incorrect to the era the movie takes place in. <br><br>Humankind or people kind is the Woke terminology of mankind. <br><br>People who do not say mankind think they are being inclusive by saying human or people kind. They fail to realize that mankind includes both male and female. Just because a word has man as part of the word does not mean it’s about men. As an example the word women has men in the word yet the word refers to women.<br><br>In the era the movie takes place in they would have said mankind.

The way shadows have been utilised as horror elements without showing the actual creature such as the dark hand looking over the entire town and the side-view curtain shadow make the set ups even more effectively dark and creepy."

@GamXxEx,2024-12-31T00:25:27Z,2024-12-31T00:25:27Z,2,"Definitely worse than Coppola&#39;s 1992 film. Orlok was given a mustache, but this is supposed to be a remake of Murnau&#39;s version, where the vampire looked like a rat. Furthermore, the connection between Orlok and Ellen is unclear. Did she summon him as some kind of spirit? Why does he drink blood from her chest instead of her neck? Too little attention was given to the important parts of the original silent film, like Hutter finding the book about vampires or Orlok carrying coffins on a cart himself.<br><br>On the bright side, the acting, cinematography, sound, and gothic style are well-executed.<br>6.5/10."

I tend to be an insufferable snob when it comes to remakes or adaptions of classics but this was pretty spot on to what I expected. Lily-Rose Depp was also really good. Wasn’t sure if she’d be another nepo baby but that girl has some acting chops! The cinematography and costumes both seem award worthy. Definitely adds to the film!

I think this has to do with crowd size and diversity of the passengers. I felt irritable at the crowd size at Windjammer, but governed my frustration. I also wasn’t drinking. When you mix this many people, add irritation elements such as swollen crowds to just have a meal, and enhance frustration with alcohol, it can be a recipe for disaster.

And I understand according to old folklore vampire drink blood from chest or straight from heart but u HV ribs protecting the heart.... Either he is Crushing d ribs with his teeth or he is using a straw...they shld HV gone for neck sucking...

@Valeriejeansolanas1,2024-12-27T17:03:10Z,2024-12-27T17:03:10Z,8,"The film not only disappointed me but also made me downright angry. It’s a prime example of how topics like sexuality are  staged, ultimately serving only the male gaze. The female lead is relentlessly sexualized, while the film claims to be about the liberation of female sexuality and forbidden desires. This pseudo-feminist premise is infuriating. If that’s the case, the director shouldn’t try to sell it as anything else.<br><br>What I saw was nothing more than a drawn-out, aestheticized depiction of sexual violence—and that’s supposed to be feminist?<br><br>What I found especially problematic was how the relationship between the protagonist and the monster was portrayed. The woman is repeatedly assaulted by this creature, yet the film frames it as an expression of her hidden, taboo desires. Even if she might have initially consented to the relationship, that doesn’t make the repeated acts of violence any less what they are. Rather than critically examining such dynamics, the film glorifies them and markets them as groundbreaking.<br><br>What bothers me even more is that many critics have celebrated this film as &quot;feminist.&quot; It feels like the audience is being taken for fools. Who genuinely believes that such a portrayal has anything to do with female empowerment or self-determination? The cinematography alone is telling: time and again, the female lead is captured in explicit, voyeuristic shots that are clearly designed to cater to male fantasies. Scenes where she’s filmed from above, approaching a man in a sexual manner, make it abundantly clear that this is not about a female perspective or liberation but about indulging a male voyeuristic gaze.<br><br>The nature shots and atmosphere in some scenes do deserve credit, but they cannot redeem the tasteless and objectionable overall depiction. Instead of breaking taboos or addressing feminist themes, the film perpetuates toxic stereotypes and cynically exploits the topic of female sexuality. All this left me feeling nothing but disappointment and the sense that my time had been wasted.<br><br>Oh, and besides all the serious criticism, the film was also boring and ridiculously dragged out 😂. Last time I felt this bored was in school. I’d almost forgotten what boredom feels like."

@partylrd8699,2024-12-26T18:18:43Z,2024-12-26T18:18:43Z,0,Finally they made a movie about the guy who was flickering the lights

@sinxster3929,2024-12-26T09:48:03Z,2024-12-26T09:48:03Z,2,complete trash 😂 not even funny just weird as hell
@prod.ohmygodd,2024-12-26T09:16:46Z,2024-12-26T09:16:46Z,2,"don&#39;t listen to the mindless haters. it was an amazing movie and if you like Robert&#39;s previous films you will like this one! an instant A24 horror classic. and orlock was the creepiest, most scary characters Bill has ever played and that is saying a lot"
@jaywillingham4085,2024-12-26T08:37:35Z,2024-12-26T08:37:35Z,2,"HUGE disappointment. First off, I absolutely hated the way Orlock looked. Looked NOTHING like the original Orlock which was the entire appeal. He could e at least bared some sort of resemblance instead having him sport a giant 70s porn mustache and male pattern baldness. Stupid. Skarsgard was great and his voice sounded ominous but he just looked ridiculous which ruined the whole thing. If the monster of the film doesnt frighten anyone then whats the point. Also I hate the fact that they kept NONE of the original iconic scenes from the original. Orlock didnt prowl around the ship, didnt rise up from his coffin, and didnt creep like he shouldve. Its a shame that a silent film from the 1920s was way creepier and than something made today."

Overall, the movie was great. yes, the plot is simple, but its great cinamtography. Simply put, i dont think the movie is for everyone, definitely takes an open mind."

This chick ruined EVERYONES LIFE because she played with demons and was being a freak. I’m good bro these new weird movies are something else….

@jyotiprakashmitra7862,2024-12-24T18:58:20Z,2024-12-24T18:58:20Z,0,"Gothic horror is popular as many observe many things &amp; ignore at the same time. When a door gets rammed all of a sudden, some say sudden breeze &amp; some say there are no breeze. However meridian observation are not same for all. Mirage doesn&#39;t means presence of absence but circumstances. Someone dying, some understand &amp; some can&#39;t. Who are they who can understand if there are some negative profiles inside the living space?  Publicity of negative profiles takes place if some one pee during running prayer! Can prayers be made in a dark space? Islam claim it has to be made! When Christ was on The Cross, none prayed &amp; Mary was constantly looking at his boy only! During resurrection Christ prayed for everyone&#39;s children! Evil&#39;s God is man &amp; not God! Merry Christmas!"

@VexWerewolf,2024-12-24T16:18:43Z,2024-12-24T16:18:43Z,1,Vampires less as a character and more as a (un)natural disaster or a force of nature.

@denzyt1039,2024-12-24T13:54:49Z,2024-12-24T13:54:49Z,1,I can agree with everyone here if it wasnt for SpongeBob in the Hash slinging slasher ep which was ironically the first time we were ever introduced to &quot;Nosferatu&quot; at the ending flickin the lights 😂. We were all kids when that episode came out back in 02 its sad n silly how we discovered the name it is what it is

@goranvisnjic9714,2024-12-24T11:17:16Z,2024-12-24T11:21:48Z,1,It&#39;s very nice to see a new version of  Nosferatu after 45 years. This movie is a combination of 79 version with Bran Stoker&#39;s Dracula and also Possession from 1982 . I love the cast. I think Lilly Rose is no match to Isabelle Adjiani. Dafoe is perfect. Bill Skarsgard is interesting choice for Orlock. I love it because he&#39;s no  where near Klaus Kinski.

I believe she&#39;s going to gain a new respect and following. I really did like Winona Ryder in Bram Stokers Dracula, so Lily is going to have some big heels to fill but I think she&#39;s going to blow it out of the water. I&#39;m rooting for her."

However, having it open on Christmas Day seems to be a miscalculation. How many people are going to want to see an art house production of a horror movie during the holiday season? This could very well doom it at the box office. I hope not, because, with the exception of &quot;The Witch&quot; (did anyone, anywhere understand what the father was saying in that film?), Eggars has made some terrific movies. I hope I&#39;m wrong, and it tops the box office for a few weeks, and allows him to create more of these moody, twisted tales."

He was never human. <br>Dracula is a normal vampire much Junger. <br>In general older vampire are much more powerful.

@The_Real_Danger_Mouse,2024-11-28T16:13:38Z,2024-11-28T16:13:38Z,2,"More than 9 remakes so far that fail to capture the horror of the original.  The draw of the original was the feeling of being trapped in a decaying city infested by the plague at all corners.  Ellen is trapped in an apartment with only two ways out, through the rat-infested corridors or jumping out the window. With few options to save the city, she confronts the vampire.  The characters in this trailer look too wealthy.  They have a plethora of resources to confront the vampire including a body of guards and armament. The 1922 Count Orlok preyed upon vulnerable, easy targets that would not draw too much attention.  Ellen was the wife of an estate agent. If he was an assistant, he would make 20% more than a common laborer.  If he authored contracts and dealt with multiple accounts and hired a handful of agents, he could make up to 3 times the common laborer&#39;s wage. In the original, he does not employ anyone and would have been an assistant to an agent. The range of salaries in 2023 US levels would be $46,000 to $127,000 per year.

An issue with this is that Bram Stoker implies heavily his Dracula to be Hunnish (possibly Attila himself masquerading as a medieval Wallachian nobleman) rather than Dacian, and Count Orlok is not Dracula.<br>Anyway we shall see what the plot of the film could have to do with Zalmoxis."

Now he is playing a different character in a remake of Nosferatu.

@Johnny.1994,2024-10-22T19:29:07Z,2024-10-22T19:29:45Z,3,My most anticipated film currently from my favorite director. It saddens me that I will not be able to watch it at the movie theater. In IMDb the movie hasn&#39;t a release date slot for my country (Greece). I was so hyped to watch it at Christmas with my brother. Disappointed that I have to wait for the digital release.

@lennydale92,2024-10-16T21:42:20Z,2024-10-16T21:42:20Z,0,Oh yeah Merry Christmas. I have a feeling it will be an awful movie.
@lennydale92,2024-10-16T21:25:31Z,2024-10-16T21:25:31Z,0,My prediction: oh monster is misunderstood! Orlok will be in a dark romance with mrs Hutter rather than the predator nightmare of the original. Orlok will either survive or will pass on his curse like in the 79 remake. There will be a lot of jump scares and less of unsettling atmosphere.

@tommyo.3535,2024-10-11T22:54:10Z,2024-10-11T22:54:10Z,0,"Recently watched Werner Herzog&#39;s Nosferatu the Vampyre. It did everything it set out to do and achieves this transcendent naturalistic quality that feels special, and yet it all still felt distant and maybe even tame. It probably is a masterpiece in a way that I can&#39;t quite meet halfway. But I know Robert Eggers can take this story farther into more treacherous territory. This trailer tells me that nobody is innocent, that maybe they aren&#39;t worth saving. Maybe the worst thing is to fall short of total annihilation, and that maybe Nosferatu was right for bringing on the plague. I think Eggers will force us to sit with these troubling thoughts, and to face all the ugly confessions of these people, before Nosferatu begins his death journey. I know it&#39;s not fair to get ahead of myself with how it might be executed but I trust in Eggers to take it where it needs to go."

The Witch needed another half an hour to develop a proper epilogue after she goes to the coven, or been given more time to develop the 3rd act, The Lighthouse had an undergrad film school ending, The Northman was just nonsense, and now this one looks a little too flashy and Hollywood to deal with the subject matter properly. Go watch Nosferatu The Vampyre instead from 1979 if you want to see a good remake of the original."

I&#39;ll never forget seeing clips of the original Nosferatu as a kid and being scared of that spindly figure at night. I always thought I would see his shadow creeping up the stairs to slip into my room. Max Schreck is one of the greatest casting decisions of all time, and I don&#39;t think Klaus Kinski and Willem Defoe were able to capture his otherworldly, preternatural stare coupled with his rat-like teeth and spidery way of moving. There was a horror to the whole package deal of that man. I personally don&#39;t think Bill Skarsgard has the face and the look for this character either. His features are a bit too effete and feminine for the job (this was the case with Kinski as well, who had a droopy sadness to his eyes that kind of clouded out the dead-stare malice of the original). So we&#39;ll see. Even if Eggers took a wrong turn with his selection for Graf Orlock, I have no doubt that this film will be a masterpiece in its own right. Eggers has never let me down."

If you haven&#39;t watched any of these, I highly recommend them. All of them.<br><br>May the third time with Robert Eggers be an equally pleasantly grotesque charm.<br><br>As a bonus, there&#39;s also Shadow of the Vampire that focuses on the making of the 1922 version, with Willem Dafoe portraying Max Shreck/ Count Orlok.<br><br>The only version I&#39;ve yet to see is the 2023 version with Doug Jones&#39;s portrayal. I&#39;ve met the man, so I&#39;ll do him the honor and check it out."

Either way, I hope this film is good!"

Nosferatu 1922, Nosferatu 1979, Shadow of the Vampyre 2000 and now Nosferatu again in 2024. That Defoe plays again a character and not the same again is a perfect bonus in my opinion."

@anthonydixon8967,2024-10-04T13:31:55Z,2024-10-04T13:31:55Z,0,Ari Aster and Robert Eggers are the most overrated directors of our time. Both make primitive horror films with lots of jump scares and no plot. Their popularity is only the work of pretentious critics who are able to convince the average person that shit in the middle of the hall is deep and intellectual art.

@JeffreyHarnden-qw8fs,2024-10-03T23:00:39Z,2024-10-03T23:00:39Z,0,Did anybody see the original from the 1020s haha just kidding. I remember growing up as a kid and watching the classic horror film horror express with Peter Cushing Christopher Lee and of course Telly savalis of co jack fame I have a feeling that that will be the next remake there does seem to be some interest in that film as seen in the second season of the series creep show. I have a feeling that someone will become interested in remaking that film. That was one of my favorite horror film growing up I hope there are others who may remember that 1972 film. I don’t mind a remake of horror express I just hope who ever does it doesn’t screw it up. This movie nosferatu looks really good. Let’s hope that a horror express remake turns out just as good although for some reason I think Jordan peele may get his hands on that one or Jason wan

They were told that the organ came from a death-row prisoner. “It’s quite a shock,” she said after knowing that the organ came from an innocent living person. “It’s impossible to have that many people die and donate their organs every day. The number of transplants was unfathomable.” <br><br><br>Taichung City Councilor Chen Ya-Hui said that no one should have their organs harvested against their will.<br><br>Ms. Chen said she often saw Falun Dafa practitioners meditating in the park when she went there for morning exercises. She believed that no one should have their organs taken against his will, especially for such a big peaceful group being the main target in the crime. “We are all human beings and we should not take organs from others just because we want to live,” she stressed that everyone should receive organs from legal donations, not killing. <br><br>She continued to say that live organ harvesting was cruel. In Taiwan, if someone disappears, the authorities would try their best to find him or her. It’s absolutely not permitted for someone to be killed for their organs in Taiwan. She would jointly sign the motion against organ harvesting in the City Council."

I can&#39;t watch this film this role is difficult for him as far as I can see his expressions in every film are very stiff without emotion could it be that he was chosen for this? so ridiculous.

NOSFERATU is the result of a creative alliance spanning two centuries: Bram Stoker gave us Dracula in 1897--Murnau gave us Nosferatu in 1922---Werner Herzog breathed new unlife into it in 1979...and now Eggers puts the icing on the stake.

@alexisstorie111,2024-10-01T18:25:50Z,2024-10-01T18:28:50Z,1,I loved the classic nosferatu (1922) because it was silent and had a very gothic horror vibe to it. The one from 1979 herzogs was also great but This looks just as amazing. I really hope it stays very close to the storyline and we see him just as much as the 1922 one.

But I have a couple criticisms:<br>- There needs to be a black-and-white version; silent would be an awesome bonus<br>- I dislike the &quot;larger than life&quot; portrayal of Orlok here, it removes probably the scariest thing about him from the original: his humanity. His normalcy made his <i>lack</i> of it so much more disturbing. Here, dude&#39;s literally an eldritch, demonic entity, which is cool, don&#39;t get me wrong. But it lacks tangibility.<br><br>Either way, Dafoe is going to kill this performance, I know it."

From these trailers alone it is clear that it will be different from the 1927 F.W. Murnau, and the 1979 Werner Herzog version. Unlike the criminally under seen The Northman, you guys better show up to the theatres for this."
@VeritabIlIti,2024-10-01T03:22:36Z,2024-10-01T03:22:36Z,1,The fact that this is the first full trailer after the teaser and we&#39;ve still only (maybe) seen eyes and a shadow gives much hope for this. Like Eggers can do any wrong!

@goodknightned,2024-10-01T01:37:17Z,2024-10-01T01:37:17Z,1,Fitting that Willem Dafoe should be in this. He was fantastic as Count Orlok in &quot;Shadows of the Vampire&quot; from 2000. I was actually very much into &quot;Nosferatu&quot; when I was a teenager; it just chilled me to the bone. It had this chilling chthonic quality that was hard to turn away from. F.W. Murnau did something special then in the name of terror and fear.

Love the casting of Willem Dafoe as the Van Helsing stand in, it’s cool to see Nicholas Hoult in another film related to Dracula as a different character, and I’m impressed by how little we see of Bill Skarsgård as Orlok.

@wisperingbeard,2024-09-30T22:54:29Z,2024-09-30T22:54:29Z,0,If that glimpse we got of Orlock’s face is the final look then I’m a little disappointed. The genius of Max Schreck’s look in the original is the almost human appearance of his face. Everything about him was an exaggeration of humanity. A perversion of it even. But if Eggers is just gonna give us another bat mutant then I’m not holding out hope.

The falsetto part.I saw Bramstokers Dracula in the theater, we waited a couple years for it after it was announced. And I loved every second of it. And the soundtrack is probably my fav horror related on. I had a death metal band and we would intro the band with it.  I’m so fkn stoked about this film. Robert Eggers will go down history as a masterful film maker. Happy for him."

His last film, The Northman, wasn’t Norse aside a few actors, but he had them speak thusly. Here, and especially towards his favorite film of all time, I’m surprised they’re not going for German accents. <br><br>Other than that, I’m still immensely excited for this movie. That curtain shot was PEAK"

I’m hoping they create Orlok with makeup rather than just CG all over the place. Given what I’ve seen of Eggers he’ll probably want to respect that."

@redadamearth,2024-09-30T18:58:11Z,2024-09-30T19:02:34Z,0,"Honestly, I&#39;m kind of surprised by the fact that visually and tonally, this doesn&#39;t look much different than Coppola&#39;s &quot;Dracula&quot;, albeit with better acting for Harker. I would have thought Eggers would have added more visionary elements to the story. It just looks like a very....traditional telling of Stoker&#39;s story with some extremely rote horror visuals. The little girls, the curtain, the shadows, it just all looks rather &quot;done&quot; to me. Hoping that the trailer is a red herring and that there&#39;s something new, here. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m always down for a well-told version of the story, just hoping there&#39;s something new brought to it."

But Mina does.  Dracula may be jerk but she believes she is the one special girl who has access to his true tenderness and truly understands him and so remains addicted to her abusive relationship with him.  Knowing how modern films go, this will likely be a symbolic movie of Dracula giving Mina the power to rise above the evil society that holds back her greatness.  Nevermind all they people he kills... the movie will justify it as they were part of that evil society and thus worthy of destruction."

@battousai9795,2024-09-30T17:49:18Z,2024-09-30T17:49:18Z,0,"I&#39;m not saying that this is going to be bad, because it looks great, it&#39;s just that this feels way too... movie-like? The thing about the original and the 79 remake was that they weren&#39;t super big budget films, and that gave them a feeling of being something that might have actually happened, even when it obviously didn&#39;t and wouldn&#39;t even be possible. This comes across as less genuine for some reason. It&#39;s very clearly a Hollywood production with movie sets, costume design, big name authors, and very intentional cinematography. It doesn&#39;t feel like I&#39;m gonna go see the Nosferatu story, it feels like I&#39;m gonna go watch Robert Egger&#39;s work. It doesn&#39;t have that visceral feeling that the other two had."

Literally zero. The holiday release date worked for Scream, but that was a fluke decades ago, and it wasn’t on bloody Christmas Day. That’s really taking this piss. What is this aversion to releasing horror movies in October? Do you know how many people would go and see this in October? I would. All my friends would. I will not however be going out to see this on Christmas Day and will most likely wait till it’s out on streaming. Again, had it been October you’d have got my money. If you insist on it being a Christmas movie, at least release it before Christmas Day. Do you know when everyone goes to the theater at Christmas? On Christmas Eve. You know that, right?"

@jonasulrich,2024-09-30T16:33:41Z,2024-09-30T16:33:41Z,0,"I&#39;m not sold by the casting... when did Eggers go that mainstream? I think the casting in THE VVITCH was phenomenal precisely because it wasn&#39;t well-known faces, which really helped you to get into the period setting. And even if Dafoe and Pattinson are well-known, their casting in THE LIGHTHOUSE was inspired and surprising. But this? Sure, Dafoe looks good. But Lily-Rose Depp? That&#39;s the best young actress you could find? Might as well have cast Lily Collins. And Nicholas Hoult? Dude just starred in a Dracula comedy LAST YEAR. An overused Hollywood face with zero edge to it. Fingers crossed for Orlok himself, but here as well... Bill Skarskard? The guy who gets cast as creepy bad guy in EVERY hollywood (horror) movie? OK."

This is probably going to flop simply because nobody want to watch movies like this in December. Which means we won&#39;t get more good period piece horror. Whoever missed the chance at a October release date needs to be fired. This is a halloween film.

@songtoan339,2024-09-30T15:37:45Z,2024-09-30T15:37:45Z,0,The movie have a very dark story just like “the last voyage of the demeter” I like it 🙋🏻‍♂️

Seems a lot more amped up &amp; Hollywoodised than the creepy, quiet &amp; restrained other versions which I think worked beautifully. Sometimes less is more. This looks more like your typical CGI-heavy, loud Hollywood horror movie."
