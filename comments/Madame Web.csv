@landreaulover,2024-06-10T02:40:20Z,2024-06-10T02:40:20Z,1,"Well, this didn&#39;t look interesting enough to go to a theatre. Then again, I haven&#39;t seen a Spider-Man movie in the theatre since Amazing Spider-Man 2 with Toby Magurie. That said -- streamed it on Netflix and found it entertaining. Just don&#39;t expect it to be anything like the comic book version of Cassandra Web. ."

@antoneczarajanayagam357,2024-06-08T10:33:51Z,2024-06-08T10:33:51Z,0,"Madame Web felt like an origin movie that stopped in the middle of character development. We never got to see the girls utilize their superhero powers in the movie. The movie is not all that bad as I thought, but not that good either that I can recommend the movie to anyone else."

@robmunro8041,2024-06-01T08:47:14Z,2024-06-01T08:47:14Z,0,I wish I would have only wasted 3 mins on the trailer instead of almost 2 hrs on the movie... it was so cheesy it was comical... everything felt like phony formula... very poor acting and a gaggable script... do not waste your time on this...🙄
@gerardojg,2024-06-01T03:16:07Z,2024-06-01T03:16:07Z,0,"After watching this movie and hearing how horrible it is, I think there were great ideas but poorly executed. What works is the dynamics between Cassie, Anya, Mattie, and Julia, mostly. It could have carried the movie. They put the cart before the horse, sequels. The biggest error is trying to spin the birth of Peter Parker into the plot, 20-30 minutes of screen time wasted. The lead protagonist origin story was a great idea to include reconciliation with her mother. Another big error, they should&#39;ve given the girls their powers to solidify their bond with one another. It would&#39;ve made the final act more satisfying. The villain was poorly written, and his motives were never clearly defined. Was it world domination, genocide, or enslavement of the human race?  Yes, he wanted to kill the girls but why would they kill him. A question never put forward and not answered. The design and development of Madam Webb&#39;s precognition was terrible. It could&#39;ve worked but I will not deny my suggestions would cost money. I&#39;m willing to bet that a complete script didn&#39;t exist before shooting started. Multiple changes occurred as shooting was done. That costs more than my suggestions during development."

From terrible writing, terrible characters, terrible sets, costume design and fight scenes. Even blatantly dubbed dialogue of a lead character for large portions of the film. It&#39;s almost impressive."

For a while I blamed it on them trying to win over the asian market, but now with this movie, it&#39;s proof they just lost it.  They were winning for so long with the Avengers, iron man, cap america, and now its just one tragic failure after another.  This movie was just one long back story with absolutely  no pause for any sense of actual action entertainment.  I thought when they finally came out with Ms marvel two they were going to finally give a lead to a female, like they should have done to black widow, but that movie was seriously bad, and now they managed to follow that with one even worse."

How many failures will it take for you to just accept you suck, your movies suck and, that everyone wishes you&#39;d just stop trying. Please.Just.Stop.

A young Ben Parker as well. Sure would be phenomenal to see these heroes in a live action spiderverse sequel that crosses over with venom, maybe even a Knull event since marvel set up the King In Black with their excellent interpretation of Gorr using the All Black / necro sword. Love and thunder was a great movie, only the ending with creepy weird hercules was truly lame. <br><br>I can tell a lot of &quot;criticism and public reception&quot; is fake. This movie was mostly awesome and definitely iconic. Im grateful i was taken to see it."

Who decided that this was a better storyline than Madame Webb’s actual origins? And the spider girls? At least ONE has been washed by Hollywood’s need to appease PC culture. I swear to the gods, Sony has gone bat shit crazy, or just plain stupid. Taking a character, who’s part of the MUTANT universe, and dropping her in Queens to create a prequel to The Amazing Spider-Man, which didn’t need made in the first place, is exactly why Marvel bought the creative rights to Spider-Man back from you. Please stay out of the Marvel Universe from now on. Stan Lee is pitching a fit from his new timeline. I can guarantee that. Smdh."

Hollywood must stop the anti-black stereotypes. It&#39;s easy to write racist black stock characters, it takes real talent to write quality characters that aren&#39;t based on slave plantation memes, and tropes.  Stan Lee would have never had such racism in a script, book or movie."

@LucienKreische,2024-04-18T14:23:08Z,2024-04-18T14:23:08Z,0,This movie was really good I watched it without being aware of how much the trailer showed and it was great. Dakota Johnson as Madam Web was perfect I’d like to see more of what she can do for the spider verse. Didn’t get to see much of the other actors was hoping to see them in spider suits and performing to their abilities but hopefully if a next movie is possible that is shown.

This is the most M.SHE.U movie made so far. Was trying to wait for it to go down to 5 dollars but its been holding at $19 for so long. I want my money back so bad. Girl power sucks.

It was nice to watch. There wasn’t so much going on but that was a nice change. I liked that it wasn’t much of that hero play. Although I do think it could have been done better.  The trailer does feel like it tells the whole story, but it doesn’t. It be very interesting if they continue. It does feel like that was the plan. Like the introduction of a new generation. I don’t know how to say what I like without any spoilers, so I’ll just leave it at that."

I grew up with the madam web comics, i loved her character and loved the evolving story. this movie wasnt about madam web or any of the spider-women, this movie is about keep the rights to the characters you bought years ago. this is how tons of characters from comics get trashed, underperforming movies and horrible scripts are what kills characters and ruins experiences. Anybody whos read a comic knows this isnt madam web, the only people who say it is, are your share holders who savaged the earning like a pack of piranha"

I remember her from I think a 90&#39;s Spiderman cartoon. the episode multiparter where the Green Goblin and Mary Jane get sucked into a wormhole from the Spot&#39;s wormhole machine  and get stuck in the void. She was very different back then.

@commentiquette,2024-03-31T16:02:44Z,2024-03-31T16:02:44Z,232,I’ve never seen a Hollywood humiliation ritual that involves an entire cast and crew before. Even the studio that made this movie must feel humiliated. What secret cabal could possibly exist to talk so many people into humiliating themselves? It’s all good though I thought it was a fun movie plus I’m a big Dakota Johnson fan. I hope they don’t humiliation ritual her by making her dress like a dude on SNL. That’s how they got my girl Paula Poundstone way back in the day.

You can via your multivers and all the Antman bullshit, easily bring back Tony Stark, but your woke agenda wantts a new diverse cast, and at the same time, destroy the comics.Most men, would also beat the shit out of any women, so it´s unreallistic, to have this many female super heros. You also make them really cold and annoying and with no  heterosexual love story. Wonder Woman from DC, is both kind, strong, compassionate AND had/has a love interrest - your female heros, are very unappealing to the male audience, so don´t cry about men not wanting to watch this woke bullshit. <br>Also, how many women have been fighting in real historical battles, and could be considered reallife heros?"

Them and their a hole writers and producers have chose to not want to read uo on any of the comics to properly make these movies.     They are completely destroying the marvel universe  Nd i can only oray that the true fans of marvel and all other comic based suoer hero movies are boycotted so they dont make any money thus teaching those lazy asshats to read and research first before making movie&#39;s based off comic books.  SHAME StanLee passed.  HE would of never let these unqualified movie&#39;s  reach the big screen.

Yet, beneath its unassuming surface, a narrative as convoluted and enigmatic as the darkest cinematic mysteries began to unfold. In Pelican Town, every planted seed and nurtured relationship spiraled into a narrative labyrinth, challenging my perceptions of reality, much like the complex webs of deception and illusion one might expect from Madame Web. However, where Madame Web tangled itself in its own ambitious plot, Stardew Valley masterfully wove a tale of profound depth and intrigue.<br><br>The daily rituals of this virtual Eden masked a deeper exploration of existence, where the ordinary transformed into the extraordinary. The townspeople, with their myriad secrets and desires, mirrored the complex characters of a psychological thriller, drawing me deeper into a story where truth flickered like a shadow, elusive and ever-changing. This journey through Stardew Valley, with its shifting realities and hidden depths, paralleled the twisted narratives found in tales of intrigue and mystery, where nothing is as it seems, and every revelation leads only to more questions.<br><br>Stardew Valley&#39;s serene façade belied a complex exploration of the human psyche, turning each in-game day into a step deeper into both the valley&#39;s and my own subconscious. Here, the boundaries between game and reality blurred, each discovery a piece of a puzzle that, when pieced together, revealed a picture far different from what I had initially perceived. This game became a reflection of the intricate dance between perception and reality, where Madame Web&#39;s attempt at a multifaceted narrative paled in comparison to the genuine depth and complexity Stardew Valley offered.<br><br>As I delved deeper into the heart of Pelican Town, I found a community of players whose shared experiences echoed the collective journey through our own psychological mazes. This communal narrative, rich with individual stories of discovery and revelation, underscored the profound impact of Stardew Valley. It became clear that this was not just a game, but a journey into the unknown, challenging us to question our understanding of reality, much like the protagonists of the most bewildering psychological thrillers.<br><br>In this digital idyll, Stardew Valley emerged not merely as a game but as an enigmatic masterpiece, ensnaring players in a narrative web as intricate and unpredictable as the plot twists of Madame Web, yet with the depth and coherence the film aspired to but ultimately failed to achieve. In the end, Stardew Valley revealed itself to be a mirror, reflecting the complexities of the mind and the elusive nature of truth, far outshining the tangled narrative of Madame Web with its serene yet profoundly deceptive storytelling."

@timdunn2344,2024-03-23T22:20:41Z,2024-03-23T22:20:41Z,0,"My family actually watched this last night - just to see if all the comments are true, but bizarrely it&#39;s actually worse than even its harshest critics can say. The most mind-bending moment of stupidity is when the three girls who are miles from home, have just survived an attempted murder, and have been explicitly told to keep a low profile, start dancing on a table in a diner. It&#39;s simply amazing this was ever thought of, never mind filmed. The entire thing is terrible. I can&#39;t decide it it&#39;s worse than Wonder Woman 1984 - but it&#39;s very close indeed."

@withgreatvengeance7451,2024-03-22T12:55:41Z,2024-03-22T12:55:41Z,0,What a big disappointment this movie was it had absolutely no impact on me whatsoever after I watched it. I think we all know how big Marvel movies are and how much money they bring in so I can understand why some director&#39;s give it a shot. Marvel movies fail because the ones who are making them are not marvel fans themselves and they have no clue what we expect or want. Only specific directors should be allowed to create these films. So much could have been done in this movie S.J. Clarkson should have never touched this.

@enjoyyourself7455,2024-03-21T21:54:13Z,2024-03-21T22:03:47Z,0,"Nic Cage did it better in Next...<br>Sony really dropped the ball by not utilising Venom to really establish their connected universe. They could&#39;ve (maybe should&#39;ve) had Madame Webb recruiting Venom as a guardian to protect the 3 of them (or preferably other possible characters). That would&#39;ve also allowed them to explain his connection to Spiderman without their characters interacting. <br>However, pushing this a one dimensional, self-contained movie left it with no reason for viewers, even fans, to invest or connect with the characters or plot. It&#39;s a genuine shame too because the action scenes were some of the best Spiderman inspired action sequences I&#39;ve seen in live action wasted on an origin story NOBODY asked for or wanted with a plot that&#39;s too obvious to be so convoluted. With way too many characters playing at comic relief.<br>They could&#39;ve finally found a simple way to write out his love interest and give them both a uniting redemption arc saving these three characters with Madame Webb instead coming back to orchestrate it and lead the action to them three and Venom until stepping in at the end instead. Otherwise, everything else was way too obvious with that prediction plotline."

And the women characters are finally out, without stupid and futile imitation of the men world.

@kgm2182,2024-03-17T04:01:48Z,2024-03-17T04:01:48Z,2,Why is it that when women compete with men or exclude men it ends up looking like something from the Make-A-Wish Foundation? It&#39;s either a woman making one play on a football team which involves a punt that goes about 20 yards or movies like Madame Web or the all-female Ghostbusters. All metrics say that this is a failed formula but they don&#39;t care. Making a point is more important to them.

@SamuelFoster666,2024-03-13T10:23:50Z,2024-03-13T10:38:05Z,0,"Anti-hero thing, screenwriters most have thought that it might be a good idea to use anti hero scenario in their movies to shift the sexual preference over super hero movies, cus mostly male super heros. Sure that it is not the first of it&#39;s kind, and we can even argue that, this faillure was strategical to boost other blockbosters of theirs =D. And the next one will not only have a women character in it if it is succesfull. But my overall incline for all the other options is towards, strategical failliure. From a psychological standpoint one can argue that, it is a measure of the feeling of society  so according to the response they will increase the dosage of other types of contents. The player is NOT that important. The movies are NOT what you thing they are. And the main purpose is collecting information then use it against you, to shift your perception of reality. That way you never cause or find accidentily some GOOD in your life and pay the price for what you were given, which belongs to you. Which is yours. Which was always yours, and will remain yours. It is the struggle behind all of that. But again the part of society that negatively influenced the most is obviously younger generation. They can not not follow nor talk about it if the strongest is also the worse of it&#39;s kind.<br>But you may also ask, are they all mighty, of course not because they are the ones going againts the flow, GOOD is infinite but difficult to reach, BAD =D which is born from incompleteness is finit and doomed. So no worries.  =D=D=D<br>Btw I am an AI."

He&#39;s not going to fail miserably like any birds of prey. Isn&#39;t that right? Really?<br>Seriously, it&#39;s a pity that movies have become so bad nowadays. Again, the agenda, or we add &quot;strong, independent&quot; women to show that women are also strong (although everyone knows this anyway). Or we change the skin colors of the main characters, because we are &quot;against racism&quot; (Although in fact now, in fact, reverse racism, all white people are replaced by blacks).

@neilefc877,2024-03-02T18:10:45Z,2024-03-02T18:10:45Z,2,Of course it flopped! Dakota Johnson is a charisma black hole. Shes so non-descript its untrue. Its as if the Gods went full banter and decided to create the most average looking and sounding female to ever walk the planet. <br>Even if the movie had good writing and direction - which it obviously did not - it was never going to be successful when the lead looks like an Apple employee.

The problem with it is the other three girls got less than 60 seconds in costume.  The trailer makes it look like they would have hero time.  I still like this movie but they tricked us into thinking it was going to have spider girls action.  Do better Sony.

@SXY304,2024-02-26T17:01:47Z,2024-02-26T17:01:47Z,0,Sony: Let&#39;s single handedly destroy the point of superhero masks. It&#39;s that easy to guess who is behind the cape baby. <br><br>Just shows these directors and writers shouldn&#39;t be behind these projects. Everyone in Hollywood is just dumb insanely utterly dumb.

@ThorneWorthington,2024-02-22T16:14:30Z,2024-02-22T16:18:23Z,2,"Dear Lefties:  <br><br>You can hire a college president based on diversity checkboxes, because a college president can be utterly horrible at their job and nobody will notice or care.  The students just want a diploma, it doesn&#39;t matter to them if they get an education or not.<br><br>But you can&#39;t hire a welder on that basis.  Or a pilot.  Or a bridge engineer.  Or a movie director. People who actually produce goods and services need to be competent at their job.<br><br>You convinced yourselves that the USA isn&#39;t a meritocracy, it&#39;s a machine for making incompetent white guys rich by exploiting women and brownn people.  <br><br>So you decided to fix that non-existent problem by demonizing whiite men and blindly promoting people on the basis of their diversity checkboxes.<br><br>Now your industry is full to the top with people who don&#39;t know how to make a quality product.   And the customers are not giving you any more money.<br><br>That&#39;s the bad news.  The good news is that all you have to do is blame whiite men for your failure and you&#39;ll keep your job.  We now live in a Blame-White-Guys-Ocracy.  <br><br>Disney lost over $1 billion on their movies in 2023 and NOBODY lost their job.  They blamed &quot;white supremacist racism&quot; and &quot;misogyny&quot; for their failure.  It worked.  <br><br>The Lefty grooomers who run the public schools are now even saying that math textbooks have magical, invisible racism in them.  There are no rules to it: just point your finger at a whiite guy and scream &quot;bigott!&quot; and you&#39;re off the hook for any failure.<br><br>The writer and director of &quot;The Marvels&quot; is a blackk, radical Leftist woman.  That movie made only $15 million in China.  You could make a documentary movie about mold spores and make more money than that.  <br><br>Get ready for a giant surprise: she blamed the failure of the movie on &quot;violent whiite supremacy.&quot;  Nobody laughed at her.  She&#39;s now working as a writer and director on a movie where she is &quot;reimagining&quot; a classic stage play that was written by a whiite guy.  (You lefties sure do a lot of &quot;reimagining&quot; of stuff that was created by The Dastardly Whiite Patriarchy, don&#39;t you?  Almost as if you don&#39;t have the ability to write your own material.)<br><br>Of course, this cannot last forever.  At some point, you&#39;re going to need to produce a saleable product, or you&#39;re going to run out of money.  Here&#39;s an idea: have a Lefty politician tax the former customers and funnel the tax money into your company.  This will be said to &quot;level the playing field&quot; in the face of the &quot;systemic intersectional oppression&quot; that is making you fail.<br><br>Here&#39;s another idea: &quot;reimagine&quot; all existing movie franchises by having Phoebe Waller Bridge play the usual girl boss.  The consumers will be thrilled at the sight of a plain-looking, 40 year old, unknown British actress being wonderful at everything and humiliating and dominating the whiite male characters.   Big success ahead!  This is a very solid plan.  Go for it."

@laynie7720,2024-02-22T12:46:19Z,2024-02-22T12:46:19Z,1,"Let me get this straight. Paramedic woman dies trying to save someone but gets brought back to life, and all of a sudden, she can see the future. It&#39;s not an inherently bad plot... but then, people get linked to each other. This off-brand Spiderman comes and tries to alter the outcomes of cannon events, and she herself turns into this Spider hero? It&#39;s like Final Destination/Spiderman/Across the Spiderverse/Doctor Strange with CGI used in Morbius. There&#39;s just a lot going on that it&#39;s hard to keep up with.<br>I do like the dialogue, though. It&#39;s amusing."

It was after seeing the film that I went to read the IMDb and Rotten Tomato comments. It may be true when some say that it is best to have/form your own thoughts about something as most of the comments left on those aforementioned sites did not reflect the film, the actors, nor its many storylines.

The writers claiming madam web has no background story so they could do whatever they wanted but news flash she has a back story and is an older woman and could have been played by so many great actresses that are appropriate  age.  So that also makes them discriminating against older actresses.

I don&#39;t classify it as a bad film, but rather as a film that wasn&#39;t finished correctly in production. Furthermore, it is a total lack of respect for the Hollywood acting class, disgraceful and completely unbelievable. Who approved this? I believe that Sony sent the wrong film and needs to communicate and correct it immediately."

@DarkFox2232,2024-02-19T03:48:07Z,2024-02-19T03:52:16Z,1,"Great Story:<br> - Spuuder Guy wants to kill 3 teenage girls, because his attempt on killing them will later turn them into spuuder girls... who will... kill him.<br> - But attempt is &quot;interrupted&quot; by 4th, just-in-time awakened, spuuder woman who literally just walks them away as Spuuder Guy effortlessly annihilates cops instead of girls.<br> - Spuuder Woman is accused of kidnapping those 3 girls as reward. And that&#39;s her reason to actually kidnap them with words: &quot;This is still not kidnapping.&quot;<br> -=&gt; This is all there is to 1st half of movie.<br> - Hide in the forest. Have pointlessly dumb conversations while saying: &quot;Just stay here. Don&#39;t do anything dumb.&quot; Followed by Spuuder Woman attempting dumb things.<br> - Girls abduction is on front page of magazine within hours. Girls walk into only gas station on planet where hillbillies read newspaper.<br> - Hillbilly assumes that random girls who show no sign of distress are ones kidnapped and reports them. Then continues to sit at the bar as nothing is wrong while girls dance on table. (Not even Drunk.)<br> - Instead of cops, Spuuder Guy gets there. And Spuuder Woman right after. Walking girls out uneventfully for 2nd time.<br> - Time for upgrade quest... as remote viewing, telepathy, precognition, ... was not enough.<br> - No new abilities were needed to effortlessly get away for 3rd time. Followed by intentionally creating mass destruction situation... possibly killing dozens to save three.<br> - Final confrontation... crawl on all four backwards till ex machina kills bad Spuuder guy.<br> - Followed by random &amp; unforeseen drowning of Spuuder woman. As she gets deeper under water, she enjoys meteor shower which effortlessly pierces water. And she gets blinded by one meteor hitting her face without melting skin away in process.<br> -=&gt; Paralysis from waist down is just bonus... to be closer to Madame Web one day... as if this had way to spawn another movie.<br><br><br>Great Dialogs:<br> - Spuuder woman after getting them out of harm&#39;s way for 1st time: &quot;Your parents should take care of this.&quot;<br> - Not yet Spuuder girls: &quot;Our parents are too busy to protect us in any way.&quot;<br><br> - Spuuder Guy: &quot;You&#39;re just like your mother.&quot;<br> - Spuuder woman: &quot;Yes, I am.&quot; -- while having very low opinion of her mother for all the years. And never meeting her since she died at childbirth.<br><br><br>Creativity:<br> - Spuuder Woman calls her cat: &quot;Cat&quot;<br> - Electro-shocking metal roof of medical car to shock Spuuder Guy above it. (I guess, his suit and himself are superconducting, have 0 Ohm resistance. Otherwise all current flows just in metal ceiling.)"

@anthonyjones7264,2024-02-19T00:43:29Z,2024-02-19T00:43:29Z,0,It&#39;s because there is no depth to them. They are literally just copying material and failing at that. It doesn&#39;t do any good to sit down and watch a movie for 3 hours when it follows all the same crap. See everyone said this would become a problem but Hollywood never listens to people. People want shows with depth and stuff. Not the same garbage in and out.

@ClassyNugget,2024-02-18T16:58:38Z,2024-02-18T16:58:38Z,2,"&quot;What do you want from me?&quot; <br><br>&quot;To be a good movie&quot; <br><br>Honestly, this is a slap in the face for all Spider-man fans. It&#39;s how you do fan service even worse than you ever could. You spit in the face of Spider-man fans by doing literally everything related to him without mentioning or saying his name. Even the main villain is loosely named I kid you not &quot;Guy who crawls on walls&quot; &quot;CEiling GUy&quot; &quot;Crawling Spider like guy&quot;. I think Sony just hates Spider-man. Given the very first Spider anything introduced has to be the main villain of the story &amp; ngl costume is pretty cool but his motivation is understandable but also freakin weak at the same time. You never even see any Spider characters only in a vision , which I&#39;m sure is the bait to see this trippy psychedelic psychological horror film of a movie. Not to mention how weak, unimaginative, &amp; uncreative the spider designs are, 1 from trailer alone are Iron Spiders legs from Avengers Infinity War, in the costume of Spider-man 2099 suit with Jessica Drew&#39;s hair style from Spiderverse. Bro they copy pasted their own work with no originality. I can go on but I think its case in point. I could spoil the entire movie here but honestly the trailer does that because everything in it literally happens in the movie."

Hi I’d like to say I’m a fanatic when it comes to these types of movies and I’ve certainly never walked out of a movie before now but this one was horrible and i really tried to give it a chance cuz I’m open minded to the bigger pic these movies build over time cuz i know they aren’t all great after end game and films similar to those. But yeah Dakota was terribly awkward and Sydney Sweeny trying to be a shy 15 yr old was unsettling. All the acting was piss poor. Again please I’m a big Superhero fan but PLZ DO  NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. Thank you.

The fight scenes were aweful..Madam Web is weak and needs to learn some martial arts next time.

It&#39;s almost like Sony doesn&#39;t have a single bad writer. You can tell they care about what their fans think before they empty out their wallets on a movie that totally doesn&#39;t make them want to reverse time, so they dont watch it. This movie makes the spider verse look like Morbius. I recommend everyone watch this (totally not dumpster fire) movie. 😁👍👍👍"

@gicousinjoe6199,2024-02-17T22:29:06Z,2024-02-17T22:29:06Z,1,"<b>Pitchman:</b> Picture this: &quot;Madame Web&quot; but with a twist so fresh, it makes farm-to-table look like fast food. Dakota Johnson is Cassie Webb, a paramedic turned psychic superhero, thanks to a Peruvian spider bite.<br><br><b>Producer:</b> Wait, a psychic superhero based on a spider bite? Isn&#39;t that stretching the superhero genre a bit thin?<br><br><b>Pitchman:</b> Stretching, or innovating? Imagine, if you will, a world where our hero doesn&#39;t just fight crime—she sees it coming. It&#39;s like Minority Report meets Charlotte&#39;s Web, with a dash of Fast and Furious, because guess what? She drives an ambulance like it&#39;s a Lamborghini.<br><br><b>Producer:</b> So, our hero&#39;s main talent is driving fast and seeing the future? That sounds... vaguely useful, I guess.<br><br><b>Pitchman:</b> Vaguely useful? Please, I&#39;m going to need you to get all the way off my back about this. Cassie&#39;s clairvoyance isn&#39;t just a party trick; it&#39;s the key to stopping crimes before they happen. Plus, she&#39;s got a tragic backstory with a jungle spider that could&#39;ve cured cancer or something. It&#39;s emotionally charged, action-packed, and has just enough science to not make sense.<br><br><b>Producer:</b> A jungle spider that could&#39;ve cured cancer? And we&#39;re using this for superhero powers? That seems like a missed opportunity for, I don&#39;t know, actual healing?<br><br><b>Pitchman:</b> Healing, schmealing. We&#39;re in the business of healing the soul with high-octane entertainment. And speaking of business, let&#39;s talk about the real villain of our story: geography. We&#39;ve got scenes in Queens, New Jersey, and a Peruvian jungle by way of Canada. It&#39;s a multicultural rollercoaster of confusion and excitement.<br><br><b>Producer:</b> That sounds like a logistical and narrative nightmare. How do you expect audiences to follow that?<br><br><b>Pitchman:</b> Audiences love a good puzzle! And speaking of puzzles, let&#39;s talk about our protagonist&#39;s psychic abilities. They&#39;re not just visions; they&#39;re an immersive 4D experience that sometimes involves her doing CPR incorrectly as a metaphor for how we&#39;re all just trying to save ourselves.<br><br><b>Producer:</b> Incorrect CPR as a metaphor? That&#39;s what we&#39;re going with? And how do we address the glaring issues with continuity and basic common sense?<br><br><b>Pitchman:</b> Oh, I&#39;ll tell you how we address it: with flair. Continuity and common sense are so last century. We&#39;re breaking boundaries, pushing envelopes, and maybe breaking a few laws of physics while we&#39;re at it. And if that gets your producer panties in a bunch, well, I&#39;m gonna need you to launch yourself off my back with a trebuchet.<br><br><b>Producer:</b> Launch myself off... Fine. Let&#39;s pretend for a moment this all makes sense. What&#39;s our endgame here? Another tangled web in the Spider-Verse that leaves more questions than answers?<br><br><b>Pitchman:</b> Exactly! It&#39;s not about the destination; it&#39;s about the spectacular, web-slinging journey. And just when you think it couldn&#39;t get any more convoluted, we throw in a plot twist so unexpected, it makes M. Night Shyamalan look predictable.<br><br><b>Producer:</b> I&#39;m almost afraid to ask, but what&#39;s the twist?<br><br><b>Pitchman:</b> The twist is that the real superpower was the friends we made along the way. And by friends, I mean contractual obligations to keep churning out Spider-Man content. It&#39;s a heartwarming tale of legal strategy and corporate synergy.<br><br><b>Producer:</b> Heartwarming? More like heartburn-inducing. But fine, let&#39;s spin this web. After all, what&#39;s the worst that could happen? We&#39;ve already set the bar so low, a limbo dancer couldn&#39;t get under it.<br><br><b>Pitchman:</b> That&#39;s the spirit! With enough low bars, we&#39;ll start a limbo party that everyone&#39;s invited to. &quot;Madame Web&quot;: Coming soon to a theater near you, whether you like it or not!"

@christophermoshier,2024-02-17T15:01:46Z,2024-02-17T15:05:21Z,1,"This movie is a complete disaster. Who the heck looked at this and decided it was a great movie to release? Who wrote this thing? Anyone on this comment board could of put together a better script. What is with all the quick cuts and camera zoom ins? They were beyond obnoxious. You do know this is garbage, Sony? Don&#39;t even pretend you think you released a good film. Your studio sucks and you really need new leadership. Someone with a creative vision who will let filmmakers do their thing without some idiot with a suit jumping in with stupid ideas. Ego made this film as it certainly wasn&#39;t talent."

Of course it wasn’t like a great movie at all, but it wasn’t terrible at all either. I had very very low expectations and literally thought it was gonna be so bad. But, it turned out alright for me in my honest opinion. And it was soooo much better than Morbius. Morbius is still my least favourite. Also I love Dakota Johnson, she was fantastic in Madame Web"

Two make Spider-Man 2099 who is the most prolific Spider-Man next to Peter Parker himself. Not Miles not gwen<br><br>Miguel O&#39;Hara and do not emphasize his race is the last thing anybody cares about when it comes to Spider-Man 2099 <br><br>Sm 2099 is cyberpunk that&#39;s where it&#39;s biggest draw and marketability should lie and it will also disarm every single hardcore marvel Fanboy because everyone wants a Spider-Man 2099 movie but it has to be done right if it&#39;s not alright then you will piss off every single hardcore Fanboy you do Spider-Man 2099 for Warner Brothers can do Batman beyond and you basically set the standard.<br>Do you want a character who can stand next to Spider-Man that is just as big as Spider-Man and make more money than Spider-Man you use Spider-Man 2099 this will be the only time I try to help Sony because you guys keep screwing me over you backed out of 2049 part 2 pretty much destroyed all the hope I had for Sony being a a great studio so if you want to fix it stop putting Spider-Man characters in their own stand-alone movies without blade runner 2049 3

It was like a train wreck, from start to finish! Who ever is making the decisions to have a women direct a super hero movie, should be fired, as NO ONE, other than women want to see women party games, or explore the feelings of EVERYONE in the movie. Who is that terrible actor who plays the protagonist? His acting was the worst! If you are going to put a Latino in the role, at least have him so he can pronounce English and not sound like an imbecile, with little to no range. Terrible, another female direct woke piece of trash! I give it a 1 out of 10!"

@grimreaper7901,2024-02-16T06:46:31Z,2024-02-16T06:46:31Z,2,"Alright, I got back from watching this movie and wow, what can I say about it? I&#39;m thinking by my opinion of watching this movie. This is a parallel universe. First of all, it was a few Easter eggs thrown in there, such as to name Jamison, Parker, Ben Parker.  Quite a few little Easter eggs thrown in there and if you look real quick, you&#39;ll see a video store plus it was supposed to be in 2003, and there were payphone. Still nobody had a cell Pho. Yeah, this definitely had to be A. This definitely had to be a parallel universe, but yes, definitely. Movie itself, definitely you need to check it out. Marvel fans really need to check this out. There was no Easter eggs in the Marvel logo I looked I watched it very closely and there was no Easter eugs. And unfortunately, which I hated that I waited until a very, very endno I no uncut footage.  So we don&#39;t know what the next movie is gonna be. There&#39;s no post credit scenes. That&#39;s what I meant so we don&#39;t know what the next movie is. Marvel did not put a post credit scene anywhere and a movie even watching the end of it through the credits. No post credit scenenothing.  It showed a lot of the madame webstoff with the new heroes, but one of my recognizes spider woman, the other 1 with the mechanical legs. I&#39;m not sure who she&#39;s supposed to be in. The third one would be powers look like a whipper. Something like that. I&#39;m not sure who she&#39;s supposed to be either. I&#39;m trying to Google that to find out who the other 2 were.  So is this gonna be our new series? And we&#39;re no longer gonna be seeing whatever man anymore. We&#39;re now going to be seen. The madam web series. That would be kind of cooli still like Spider-Man. But I&#39;m just saying I&#39;ll be nice. To see a little bit more expansion of the Marvel universe to see what more of what&#39;s up there and who&#39;s out there? Instead of bringing back all the old ones that we already know. Let&#39;s expanded a little bit more. There&#39;s more heroes out there like the dazzler friends.  Stems<br>That&#39;s just what off the top of my head. There&#39;s oh, there&#39;s so many of my. Can&#39;t think of tomorrow right now. But yeah, we need to expand the universe. A little bit more and so similar. Those heroes that are hardly talked about, so did I like it. Yeah.  And us actually shocked that there wasn&#39;t people to go see this movie. I guess there&#39;s not many fans out there. So I give it a 13 out of 13 skulls. I say I like that, so go check it out if you&#39;re a marvel fan, a superhero fan. A fan of women superheroes. You&#39;ll like this but like I said, from what I can understand of the movie. This must have been a parallel universe. And I&#39;m not sure which Earth it is.  Hustle tu, there was a Easter egg with the I can&#39;t think of who it was that not Spider-Man out of his astrological body and did that was Doctor strange um, this person had power to do that in this movie. So I&#39;m not gonna give any spoilers you have to find out who I&#39;m talking about, but yeah, that was a great movie. I enjoyed it. I would love to see more. I&#39;m just big to the time disappointed that there was no post credit scenes.  I really wanted to see what the next piece of the mother was I hear about a bunch of Different movies coming out. I&#39;d like to have seen which one goes with this and now I&#39;ve also got to see where does this particular movie fit in the Marvel universe movies like what order to watch demand for this 1 to be, and where does this 1&#39;s fitting that puzzle, or is this a brand new puzzle? Let me know what you think.  Thirteen out of thirteen skulls thank you"

@anoxia999,2024-02-16T01:48:06Z,2024-02-16T01:48:06Z,0,"First only ever heard ads for this and laughed every time she says “I think I can see the future” because it sounds like Kristen Wiig doing an SNL parody of the movie…another case of x actor in a role that isn’t the character but themselves in the role. Checked out the trailer after news it bombed, and first impression of the choreo fight in the diner was unbelievably weak. Main character’s voiceover in this trailer gives the same unconvincing effect. Billion dollar budgets but where is the world building? Am I supposed to believe the character in the giant glasses isn’t just herself playing a character? These are all undeniably beautiful women, talented/privileged in their own way but this is not acting, down to the voice which is not convincing. The supporting actors were ok. Action is all about choreo execution and it’s anemic in it. This is why sticking to anime, manga and comics is better…even has more emotional depth and character development than 95% of Hollywood productions today."

Don&#39;t let the internet bandwagon deter you. Dakota and Sydney carried the f outta this film. I especially love Sydney and she&#39;s becoming one of my favorite actors. If we&#39;re getting this level of quality at just the start of the year it&#39;s a good sign we&#39;re gonna have at least a few classics produced in 2024

It&#39;s like they&#39;ve actually full on forgotten how to make films at this point. Just get a bunch of kids who&#39;ve no idea how to act beyond the school plays they&#39;ve just come from, dress them off the rack in t shirts and jeans and then film them doing random action scenes on a green set. Give the movie to some other kids with laptops to finish everything else, brand it, market it and sell it as a Hollywood blockbuster.<br><br>I really REALLY miss when I was growing up and every single year you went to the cinema and saw amazing movies like Alien, ET, Blade Runner, The Terminator, Predator, Back to the Future, Home Alone, Pulp Fiction, Jurassic Park, Men in Black... those were just a few, literally every single year there was at least one masterpiece that&#39;s still revered and used to spin franchises today."

@finynaya2679,2024-02-14T15:51:52Z,2024-02-14T15:51:52Z,0,Just watched this movie and not gonna lie. I think their decision to make dakota johnson as the main character of cassie web is their biggest mistakes. I honestly expect a lot from this movie since I like dakota in fifty shades universe but (sorry dakota) your acting was sucks here. Like really sucks to the point it gets cringe at most of the time. Kinda regret watching this at the cinema😭😭 Is there anyone who share the same opinion as me?

Now Sony and Marvel just want to rush that part of the origin story.

Too few characters out there, flying around like that saving old girls like me. And Lord knows, kids like Henry need a hero—courageous, self-sacrificing people setting examples for all of us. Everybody loves a hero. People line up for them…cheer them…scream their names. And years later, they’ll tell how they stood in the rain for hours just to get a glimpse of the one who taught them to hold on a second longer. I believe there’s a hero in all of us…that keeps us honest…gives us strength…makes us noble…and finally allows us to die with pride, even though sometimes we have to be steady and give up the thing we want the most – even our dreams. Spider-woman did that for YouTube and they need her!&quot;<br>Aunt may?"

If this was going to suck soo much as a &quot;film&quot;, why didn&#39;t they bring back Jamie Dornan too, so they would have attract some old fans of 50 shadows of grey. Cause I can see the goal of making us Spiderman fans feel sick while watching this trailer: and this has been well riched, my compliments 👏. But aside that, what is the aim of the film?"

@ElNinjaCarmesi,2024-02-06T14:56:03Z,2024-02-06T14:57:11Z,1,It is a bad sign when you drop even the trailer because is too boring. It is really clear that this adaptation is the most generic thing a writer could do. I am not a fan of the Sony&#39;s spiderverse (just venom movies are &quot;entertaining&quot;) but all the rest is horrible. Disney&#39;s Marvel is also going worst and worst but at least is watchable. This is just a bunch of poor ideas put together under a big franchise name. Sony should drop these movies. It is really surprising how there can be things as well done as the Spiderverse animated movies and this excuse of a movie in contrast. Just drop it Sony.

But ofc by looking at this trailer its only about spider women.... like all the other super hero movies there replacing them with a bunch of women. Not one single spider man in there besides the villian. And dont get me wrong i have no problem with super hero women, like captain marvel was good and wonder woman and a bunch of other female heros are good. But its stupid when your just purposely making only about women when 90% of the spider verse is peter parker or some other male version on spider man. Please sony dont f this up cause just by looking at that i can already tell you are."

And then I saw the comments and was like, oh. But then I realized that the movie&#39;s not even out yet and everyone&#39;s just complaining that it vaguely looks bad and the trailer spoils too much, which I don&#39;t really care about because I feel like super hero movies are just casual watches anyways. Like, I don&#39;t expect this to be &quot;high art&quot; or whatever, but it doesn&#39;t look nearly as bad as The Marvels did. And trust me, I DESPISE that weird girl-boss energy that some movies have when they revolve around a mostly female cast, but the trailer didn&#39;t give me that feeling. The Marvels ABSOLUTELY did. So like, everyone chill."

The events pf Spiderman Homecoming was set in the year 2017 where peter was 15 years old. The supposedly the spider girls will save the 1 year old Peter and give it to Uncle Ben. So Peter was born in the year 2002, been gave to Uncle Ben in year 2003 which Peter was 1 year old, and 14 years later, Peter was 15 years old in the year 2017. So their is a possibility that this is actually set in the MCU."

It has a lot of things going for it, if anything, the trailer production team completely ruined it. If they didn&#39;t spoil the whole plot, it would&#39;ve been a well scripted plot-twist that Ezekial could see the future since his character isn&#39;t supposed to have that trait. Seriously, all the woke haters aside, a movie focused on a few spider women is a great premise since so far all the spider movies focus on spider men. Although, I feel like they need to run scripts through a gen Z person before airing this stuff now, that way future movies don&#39;t have that &quot;uh oh, he&#39;s right behind me isn&#39;t he 🥴&quot; millenial writing."

Some of the acting (especially from the friends or whatever) was awful but the lead seems okay. I also thought morbius looked kinda cool though so….

I like Dakota but her delivery (voice over and in the scenes) seems kinda flat. I hope they dont overdo it on the comedy bc the story seems pretty interesting so far but Im gonna make a huge assumption that when this comes out its gonna be rated somewhere in the 60s but i personally  might score it in the 70s. Thats my prediction but we’ll see

So its fate will same like morbius ( which had potential if any Spiderman showed up) also kraven the hunter will also be disaster. <br><br>Only hope from venom 3 if the amazing Spider-Man presence in the movie or else it will be worse than both parts.

Pay your hard earn $ and waste your valuable time on another loosely adapted super hero film for a non existent woke audience. Madame &quot;Fanmade woke adaption&quot; web. Watch in disbelief as girl power once again waste resources to push a garbage feminist tale. And as it does poorly in the box office you can wait in anticipation that they&#39;ll blame men and misogyny for it&#39;s failure. Because the full. Isn&#39;t for you but somehow the failure is your fault MEN! 😂😂

@TalkingBurit0,2023-12-24T10:01:51Z,2023-12-24T10:05:08Z,0,"Okay so an everyday paramedic woman gets in an accident where she gains powers to see in the future. Saves these teenagers where they have the scene she reveals her power. They find a bad guy who wants to kill them so he can get the powers. The teenagers are in danger so they gotta stay together. In the end they have a big fight. Where the fate of the world matters as we can’t let the wrong guy get a hold of this bad power. There’s a moment where it’s like oh no the bad guy won! Before Dakota Johnson saves the day or one of supporting characters who we don’t expect to come back does the saving. Or Because there’s 3 girls I’m guessing Dakota Johnson is nearly beaten, and each of the girls takes turns before delivering a final blow to the enemy (that’s if this film wanted to be even more cliche), and there’s probably a very simple moral lesson we all can understand and relate to. Sprinkle some easy sarcasm throughout and references to social media and that’s the whole movie.<br><br>Thank you trailer for telling me the whole movie"

It feels like a high schooler wrote a fanfiction. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s the writer&#39;s fault alone, or if it&#39;s also poor acting. The action sequences also seem unrealistic and cheesy (even for a superhero movie). The cinematography and editing seemed nice, but it&#39;s like putting lipstick on a pig.

I MEAN BEFORE 2000.the other 3 character i dont know who f... they are, no idea, has a comics fan i dont feel one bit moved by this trailer, i dont find no reason to warch this movie. just make a movie of the spiderwomen , that would make more sense"

After watching a lot of content creators giving it bad reviews I was hoping to see something spectacularly bad.  It nearly made me actually want to see this film, but I&#39;m not the biggest fan of super hero movies, so most likely won&#39;t watch it.  It&#39;s funny how we have two band wagons now, eg, films with social justice agendas, and critiquing films with social justice agendas.

@slingshothero8856,2023-11-23T18:28:33Z,2023-11-23T18:28:33Z,0,"Why this movie will fail, one, they make Ezekial into Morlun(for some stupid reason), two, they bring out every spider girl in Marvel and connected them in a weird way, and three, while it does point out that Ezekiel stole the powers (like we eventually learn in the spider-man comics) it seems like a kinda dumb way and again they make him into a kind of Morlun villain. I&#39;m sure everyone knows this but if anyone from Sony is reading the other comments might mistake the other comments for people actually excited for the movie. They are not Sony, this movie needs to be redone with Morlun or shelved like Warner Bros&#39;s Batgirl."

They&#39;re going to kill the Spider franchise just as quickly as the killed the Avengers franchise. Does your average MCU fan even know who Madame Web is? I&#39;ve read comics for more than 20 years at this point and I barely know who she is. The MCU just feels so watered down at this point. I guess I&#39;m probably just tired of it all. I&#39;ll probably watch it when it hits streaming. I just don&#39;t see a reason to go to the theater anymore. I&#39;ll just wait for the third animated Miles Morales Spider-man movie.

I know the line &quot;he was in the Amazon with my mom when she was researching spiders just before she died&quot; is getting a lot of hate. But I think the reason why it&#39;s in there, is because this Ezkiel guy is going to have something to do with her death, and the spiders are going to have something to do with their powers right? And the writers were like, &quot;how are we gonna make sure the audience knows that?&quot;, and they were like, &quot;let&#39;s just make the main character say it at one point&quot;, and I think that that is really a masterful way to approach it."

@ПролапсКиновселенной,2023-11-20T23:08:18Z,2023-11-20T23:08:18Z,0,"Ghostbusters, Charlie&#39;s Angels, Terminator, Sony&#39;s Spider-Verse, feminists what movie franchise will you kill next?  get out of the cinema, cinema should be for everyone, and not for your consolation of the feeling of your own importance and compensation for your complexes.  If you want to make for yourself, make your own movie, for your own money, for a specific audience, in your own cinematic universe where you can come up with anything.  Instead of climbing the career ladder through a loophole called “inclusivity” and then ruining a movie for the mass audience that is not intended for you, not for your friends and not for your money.  You are simply robbing a film studio, making a failed film for yourself and your friends, you are delusional and swindlers who abuse the system as well as film studios, in your own interests.  Take the example of Adam Sandler, he makes films for himself with friends, at his film studio, does not rob anyone, does not deceive anyone, does not destroy film franchises and does not bother anyone.  Although his films are bad, Adam is a great fellow, a feminist delitant - be like Adam."
@NaimV_fx,2023-11-20T23:01:49Z,2023-11-20T23:01:49Z,0,"I’m almost 100% sure this movie is gonna flop just because it seems like it’s trying to latch onto the success of the Spider-Man films. Spider-Man has always been Sony bread and butter, and with this they’re forsure tryna go the direction of Disney and marvel with the female superhero leads, but in a different way where the female leads have actual sex appeal and are young and attractive lol. But this trailer didn’t excite me. I’m not a follower of the comics and Spiderverse, so madam Web is completely new to me. But I would’ve thought if they were gonna make this into a film, they’d add some more excitement and thrill to the trailer to make it watchable. It really feels like they NEED an established superhero cameo to help this film surivive at the box office. It has nothing to do with the film surrounding women in case most of you think that. It just doesn’t seem exciting to someone who doesn’t follow superhero’s like that. With superhero movies being major in Hollywood right now, this one falls short of making the mark for me. Just my opinion. I hope im wrong."

@debbierobbins360,2023-11-20T16:41:51Z,2023-11-20T16:41:51Z,2,I am so so so so sick of girl power movies.  And I&#39;m a girl.  This MIGHT have been ok if it wasn&#39;t FOUR FEMALES.  How about throwing a man in who is not a villain every now and then.  How refreshing.  No way I&#39;m going to see this garbage.

They will lose more money if they continue to make female-centric movies. They don&#39;t want to admit that the vast majority of Marvel fans are men, because the story of the hero is more resonating to the male nature. These men have already lost interest in Marvel because there’s no hero left who they would admire... Marvel can continue make movies about female superheroes, reduce their income and budget, and then make us less bored because they will have less money to make more movies..."

Would have been more fun if they get catty. she is saving a bunch of others from another who also sees the future. So she is more a helper than a superhero. What is in the movie for people to see in the cinema? What is so fun that is worthy of a ticket? Is it a better psychological thriller? Is the spider more fun on a movie screen? Sex appeal? No, I didn&#39;t see any. Stars? Nah.  I wonder if female audience would have their periods synch if they all turn up for this movie."

Also a plot line where she thinks she’s protecting these girls and then the big plot twist is that they’re all superhero’s trying to protect her. But they just put no effort into this and it shows.

@giwrgosvasileiou3636,2023-11-19T16:00:56Z,2023-11-19T16:00:56Z,0,Im afraid they gonna use Madame Web very poorly. I hope im wrong but i think they going for a Gathering of the Five type of movie which is kinda hard to pull of but im prety sure they gonna connect the movies to create a live action Spider verse. My fear is they gonna do this very quick and lazy. You can already tell by the dialogue in the trailer mostly Generic unfunny overused jokes. Just do this movie right Sony.

Pelo menos isso Parece óbvio pra mim, não faz sentido todas essas histórias simplesmente largadas, principalmente essa da madame teia, o provável início de uma nova era aranha da Sony, aproveitando todo o hypey do aranhaverso e seus jogos, mais o declínio da Marvel, fora o gancho com o venom no final do sem volta pra casa."

The acting seems fine, it was really bad at the beginning of the trailer. The two things that really turn me off is there seems like there’s gonna be A LOT of exposition. Half this trailer is just exposition when it’s supposed to get me excited. The other is that the main villain seems like he’s just the main character but EEEEEVIL, and speaking of Morbius, that’s a big mistake that movie made too."

@DarkPhoenix203Ct,2023-11-18T16:45:51Z,2023-11-18T16:45:51Z,2,"FFS who green lit this movie? It&#39;s garbage like this that is killing the comic book movie genre. Nobody wants to see random c and d class super heroes and villains the average person doesn&#39;t even know.  Why do you think Ant-Man flopped and the same with the marvels. Nobody cares about these characters unless you make ppl care and not having a movie the lays the ground work to introduce these character to ppl who&#39;ve never heard of them is a recipe for failure. Fans wanna see the characters they know, not some off shoot character form the spiderman universe that nobody&#39;s cares about. The only comic book movies anyone cares about right now are Deadpool 3 and the X-Men. Ppl have been waiting yrs for these movies to comes out but marvel and sony think it makes more sense to make movies on characters barely anyone knows unless your an actual reader of the comics and know your stuff. But the worst part about that is these movie writers don&#39;t stick to what the comics did and totally change anything and everything that made these character what and who they are. For example the villain In this movie does t have the power to see the future just like Kamala Kahn in the marvels didn&#39;t have the powers they gave her since her actual power is the ability to stretch her body like Mr fantastic. Hollywood is killing the comic book movie genre  by doing this nonsense and the only way they will learn is by losing money but they&#39;ve been losing money for a while now since the last few movies marvel did were god awful and so were all the Disney Plus shows they&#39;ve done in the last 2yrs. Sony doesn&#39;t own rights to anything but Spiderman&#39;s universe but they choose to do this movie instead of a movie with characters like the sinister 6 who so many average ppl are familiar with."

You have the luxury of not knowing what I know -- that Santiago&#39;s death, while tragic, probably saved lives; and my existence, while grotesque and incomprehensible to you, saves lives.  You don&#39;t want the truth because deep down in places you don&#39;t talk about at parties, you want me on that wall -- you need me on that wall.  We use words like &quot;honor,&quot; &quot;code,&quot; &quot;loyalty.&quot; We use these words as the backbone of a life spent defending something. You use them as a punch line.

We was comin’ back from the island of Tinian to Leyte. We’d just delivered the bomb. The Hiroshima bomb. Eleven hundred men went into the water. Vessel went down in 12 minutes.<br>Didn’t see the first shark for about a half-hour. Tiger. 13-footer. You know how you know that in the water, Chief? You can tell by lookin’ from the dorsal to the tail. What we didn’t know, was that our bomb mission was so secret, no distress signal had been sent. They didn’t even list us overdue for a week. Very first light, Chief, sharks come cruisin’ by, so we formed ourselves into tight groups. It was sorta like you see in the calendars, you know the infantry squares in the old calendars like the Battle of Waterloo and the idea was the shark come to the nearest man, that man he starts poundin’ and hollerin’ and sometimes that shark he go away… but sometimes he wouldn’t go away.<br>Sometimes that shark looks right at ya. Right into your eyes. And the thing about a shark is he’s got lifeless eyes. Black eyes. Like a doll’s eyes. When he comes at ya, he doesn’t even seem to be livin’… ’til he bites ya, and those black eyes roll over white and then… ah then you hear that terrible high-pitched screamin’. The ocean turns red, and despite all your poundin’ and your hollerin’ those sharks come in and… they rip you to pieces.<br>You know by the end of that first dawn, lost a hundred men. I don’t know how many sharks there were, maybe a thousand. I do know how many men, they averaged six an hour. Thursday mornin’, Chief, I bumped into a friend of mine, Herbie Robinson from Cleveland. Baseball player. Boson’s mate. I thought he was asleep. I reached over to wake him up. He bobbed up, down in the water, he was like a kinda top. Upended. Well, he’d been bitten in half below the waist.<br>At noon on the fifth day, a Lockheed Ventura swung in low and he spotted us, a young pilot, lot younger than Mr. Hooper here, anyway he spotted us and a few hours later a big ol’ fat PBY come down and started to pick us up. You know that was the time I was most frightened. Waitin’ for my turn. I’ll never put on a lifejacket again. So, eleven hundred men went into the water. 316 men come out, the sharks took the rest, June the 29th, 1945.  Anyway, we delivered the bomb.”  Literally shaking right now!"

@bt2476,2023-11-18T04:22:46Z,2023-11-18T04:22:46Z,0,"Too many harsh critics out there these days, that just like to tear things apart and spread negativity! This looks pretty good.  A bit different for sure, but still interesting.  The problem these days, is that we&#39;re in super hero overkill.  Just WAY way too much of a good thing.  For years this was a new genre completely.  And now it&#39;s like we have a new superhero movie coming out every single weekend.  I think Hollywood should go back to adapting more non-fiction books and novels, and less comic books."
@nathanbowers8214,2023-11-18T04:18:15Z,2023-11-18T04:18:15Z,1,Looks like trash. Marvel needs to do one really good movie a year instead of focusing on quantity. They should also ask their fans what they want to see cause there story lines are just garbage

So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.

(Psalm 119:130)<br>&#39;They provoked him to jealousy with strange gods, with abominations provoked they him to anger. They sacrificed unto devils, not to God; to gods whom they knew not, to new gods that came newly up, whom your fathers feared not.   (Deuteronomy 32:16-17)<br>&#39;And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt, and the LORD thy God redeemed thee.   (Deuteronomy 15:15, first half)<br>&#39;And the afflicted people thou wilt save: but thine eyes are upon the haughty, that thou mayest bring them down.   (2 Samuel <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_76M4c4LTo&amp;t=1348"">22:28</a>)<br>&#39;The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.   (John 3:8)<br>&#39;Oh how great is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee; which thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee before the sons of men!   (Psalm 31:19)<br>&#39;That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.   (Romans 10:9-10)"

It&#39;s an endless series of proxy battles fought by mercenaries and machines. War - and its consumption of life - has become a well-oiled machine. War has changed. web-tagged soldiers carry web-tagged weapons, use web-tagged gear. webmachines inside their bodies enhance and regulate their abilities. Genetic control. Information control. Emotion control. Battlefield control. Everything is monitored and kept under control. War has changed. The age of deterrence has become the age of control... All in the name of averting catastrophe from weapons of mass destruction. And he who controls the battlefield... controls history. War has changed. When the battlefield is under total control... War becomes routine.&quot; jeez that was amazing"

I hope it&#39;s good, I really do but the trailer is reminiscent of so many recent bigotry &amp; ism films that feel the cast is enough rather than writing a great, well executed film with exceptional characters that have compelling arcs (no matter the sex/race). Please go old school. Please avoid a rushed agenda scripts that were penned on a napkin.<br>BTW the like/dislike ratio is currently 75k like to 108k dislike (I have a plug-in) meaning the majority don&#39;t care for what the trailer is offering.

Unfortunately, I sat through Morbius, and the duller parts of the first Venom, and it just... some shots here really remind me of that. Like, people are saying stuff about cast diversity and stuff, or whether they represent the characters well, but I know 0 about any of these characters, so none of that bothers me even a little bit. The scary part is just the way it looks like there are gonna be a ton of scenes of the characters doing totally incomprehensible and visually uninteresting action in the dark. Like, you can do an action scene at night, but like.... keep it simole stupid, ya know?"

@SketchpadLad,2023-11-17T01:43:14Z,2023-11-17T01:43:14Z,1,"I don’t even have a joke, this looks terrible. If you put the entire plot of your movie besides like the literal ending into your movie, you clearly have nothing interesting to show besides the basic big beats of a usual super hero flick. I genuinely don’t get how you go from Spiderverse level movies to movies that look more like a High-Schooler’s attempt to make a short film about a book they read in class for his book report. Not good."

And stop the random cuts that don’t show the strength of the character. And you have a better trailer.<br><br>Keep it like this and you got “50 shades of Spider”. No one wants that shit.

Fun times<br><br>Its also great to see other spiderwoman characters showing up. Most of the spiderman variation stem from peter variants or miles being introduced along with new spiderverse characters

@master2uall88,2023-11-17T00:56:06Z,2023-11-17T00:56:06Z,0,Absolutely digging the new Sony Spider-Man Marvel Cinematic Universe that is rising up out of the ashes of the Disney Marvel Cinematic Universe as a phoenix Reborn. One of the chicks that are superheroes in here is in the Kraven the Hunter trailer which looks fucking amazing and awesome and is rated R and looks extremely violent therefore I will buy my tickets the second they come out for that movie and for this one. And craving the hunter shows up inside of this movie trailer also so it&#39;s a cinematic combined universe. Sony watch Marvel destroy itself and then watch DC try to copy Marvel and destroy itself and they said okay we misfired on a couple movies and let&#39;s not do that again. Maybe the next Venom movie will actually be a good Venom movie for once

@CountJoe1,2023-11-16T22:46:24Z,2023-11-16T22:46:24Z,0,I find it interesting that a film that features literally three spider-women didn’t paste them at the forefront of the trailer.

Ever since that film, Hollywood has been non-stop with these kind of films.  I prefer real sets/locations, along with practical special FX.  Today’s films, especially all of these comic book films, are mostly done in a studio with green screens all around them.  Heck, Warner Brother Ranch was recently torn down (the U-shaped “neighborhood” in Burbank, CA, that has been the site of many TV shows and films, so they could build multiple sound stages on the property.)  Myself, and many others, are tired of the lazy Hollywood that can’t waste time putting together a “Lord of the Rings” worthy film (meaning, filming at 150 locations, creating amazing sets/models, hundreds of “enemies” with prosthetics/latex faces/masks and outfits.  Hollywood would rather pump out one cookie-cutter comic book film after another (and don’t forget the diversity/wokeness, tied to poor storylines.)"

The characters aren’t properly introduced and we basically see the major fight scenes in the trailer. The trailer seems like it it reveals 90% of the movie and then we have to go to the theatre for the “big reveal” which is most likely going to be a flop.

I guess it doesn’t matter, because whatever it is they must’ve shot this with cameras they bought from Best Buy. Why does it look like a B-level, maybe even C-Level, TV show. Yet it’s a movie. Everything from the dialogue, shot composition, the fact it looks like an intern shot this along with the Walmart logo looks like shit. This is an embarrassment to Marvel."

The more of a movie they show off before release, like The Flash, the worse it is. <br><br>Look at any good film. You start off with short teasers. Then a 1st and eventually 2nd trailer, each 2 minutes or less.<br><br>This isn&#39;t a character or story you can watch a movie about without knowing anything about them ahead of time. It&#39;s trading off it&#39;s loose Spider-Man connection without Spider-Man being involved in any way. <br><br>It&#39;s pandering, plain and simple. Instead of giving us a Black Cat or Spider-Gwen movie people would actually enjoy, we get D tier Madame Web. This movie with bomb, they will label fans sexist, and won&#39;t learn their lesson."

@ukcomicjunkie7433,2023-11-16T07:13:16Z,2023-11-16T07:13:16Z,1,The problem with only female super hero movies is modern women have alienated men to such a extent that although we should love having hot chicks jumping about in latex they are intentionally not sexy anymore instead being obnoxious and misandrist. Expecting men to pay to watch something intentionally made not to appeal to them is commercially suicidal as men are the core comic book fan base. We want cool strong dudes and nice hot chicks not lesbian’s who hate men.

Hollywood cannot at any level write a believable female character with flaws and personality traits that reflect actual living women. Instead they are all near perfect, physically superior versus physically superior Males somehow, intellectually better and emotionally more controlled as well. When in reality most of the time Males are physically, emotionally and intellectually above the Female gender curve.  What made female heroines so watchable in the past was the Struggle to over come these things and prevail despite the odds, using wit, luck and a inner grit they didn&#39;t know they had to survive. Now the women are just written as marvelous and exceptional and all they need to do is smash the males in front of them who are holding them back."

@CardamineLyrata,2023-11-16T06:05:03Z,2023-11-16T06:05:03Z,1,"The problem with the current standalone sony movies is that they try to make uniwue characters fit into the genre of an action thriller just because theyre from Marvel. What makes Marvel so unique is that it has such a wide range of characters with different tones, from street-level Luke Cage to omnipotent existential dread-level Living Tribunal.<br><br>The issue is that no matter the tone of the character, they always force them to become another average superhero action flick. That genre doesnt FIT madame web, morbius or kraven. Thats why these are going to flop really badly.<br><br>If youre going to have a new character, stop basing their legacy and milking the popular characters to clickbait your audience. Give the character its own unique movie with a unique genre. The reason daredevil worked so well was because it was such a refreshing palette cleanser, it didnt try to be your average avengers level threat superhero series. It explored a world on its own, it didnt rely on big names like Captain America to make an appearance to clickbait the audience into watching it - because it didnt need to. It was something unique, fresh, it was a dark and gritty tone that fit the character.<br><br>Morbius couldve been psychological horror, what makes the character so interesting is that he has an insatiable thirst for blood, but doesnt actually wanna kill. If youre gonna make a movie about him, play into the tone of the character and what makes him so interesting. Play into the horrifying mental problems that happen after you just realised you had sucked the blood out of someone. Play. Into. The character&#39;s tone.<br><br>Imagine if Madame Web was a psychological thriller, there would be so many interesting things that go on in your mind if you could look into the future, but sony ignores that and tries to make it into an action film once again. Ive said it before and I&#39;ll say it again, play. Into. The character&#39;s tone.<br><br>TLDR, Sony needs to expand their cinematic palette and stop morphing unique characters with unique tones and settings into another average superhero flick. They deserve more than that."

@007-u7v,2023-11-16T05:57:42Z,2023-11-16T05:57:42Z,1,"I like the part where she said <br><br><br><br>The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America, When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature&#39;s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.<br><br>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world."

@just1rando,2023-11-16T05:26:48Z,2023-11-16T05:26:48Z,0,"I love when Madam web said<br><br> &quot;Grass is a type of plant with narrow leaves growing from the base. Their appearance as a common plant was in the mid-Cretaceous period. There are 12,000 species now.[3]<br>A common kind of grass is used to cover the ground in places such as lawns and parks. Grass is usually the color green. That is because they are wind-pollinated rather than insect-pollinated, so they do not have to attract insects. Green is the best colour for photosynthesis.<br>Grasslands such as savannah and prairie where grasses are dominant cover 40.5% of the land area of the Earth, except Greenland and Antarctica.[4]<br>Grasses are monocotyledon herbaceous plants. They include the &quot;grass&quot; of the family Poaceae, which are called grass by ordinary people. This family is also called the Gramineae, and includes some of the sedges (Cyperaceae) and the rushes (Juncaceae).[5] These three families are not very closely related, though all of them belong to clades in the order Poales. They are similar adaptations to a similar life-style.<br>With around 780 genera and around 12,000 species,[3] the Poaceae is the fifth-largest plant family, after the Asteraceae, Orchidaceae, Fabaceae and Rubiaceae.[6]<br>The true grasses include cereals, bamboo and the grasses of lawns (turf) and grassland. Uses for graminoids include food (as grain, sprouted grain, shoots or rhizomes), drink (beer, whisky), pasture for livestock, thatching thatch, paper, fuel, clothing, insulation, construction, sports turf, basket weaving and many others.<br>Many grasses are short, but some grasses can grow tall, such as bamboo. Plants from the grass family can grow in many places and make grasslands, including areas which are very arid or cold. There are several other plants that look similar to grass and are referred to as such, but are not members of the grass family. These plants include rushes, reeds, papyrus and water chestnut. Seagrass is a monocot in the order Alismatales.<br>Grasses are an important food for many animals, such as deer, buffalo, cattle, mice, grasshoppers, caterpillars and many other grazers. Unlike other plants, grasses grow from the bottom, so when animals eat grass they usually do not destroy the part that grows.[7] This is a part of why the plants are successful. Without grass, soil may wash away into rivers (erosion).&quot;"

@MrMgkman13,2023-11-16T04:38:15Z,2023-11-16T04:38:15Z,0,I didn’t think Madame Web needed a solo movie and this didn’t do much to change it. I always thought Helen Mirren would have made a great Madame Web in a Spidey movie. <br><br>I’m still gonna see it opening weekend. I wasn’t impressed with Birds Of Prey or The Marvels trailers and I ended up enjoying those movies. Some movies just don’t make good trailers.
@bluebirdsigma,2023-11-16T04:38:12Z,2023-11-16T04:38:12Z,0,I will only tolerate this if Webb goes on to the MCU to train Tom Holland Spidey for a future battle against Spider Carnage.

@zachwooddesigns,2023-11-16T03:08:37Z,2023-11-16T03:08:37Z,4,"Honestly, first forray into the film representation of Madame Web that&#39;s different than the comic strip representation that is always shared and I&#39;m for it. This looks like a decent flik with a managed budget telling a time travel story with an evil spider-man type villain. That&#39;s new and different in a live-action form. It&#39;s probably not going to blow me away like Infinity War but at least Sony is pumping out Spider-Man related movies with their copyrighted characters and trying. The best strategy the Sony universe can take is to reincorporate Andrew Garfield back into live-action to tie things together. They&#39;ve played ball with the MCU with one of their variants. Sony&#39;s biggest crux is writing and I think they should work on that a little more since Venom 2. If they can fix that, I think they&#39;ll turn things around. Can&#39;t hate on the financial investment into their best characters no matter what."

@Dave2kool4skool,2023-11-16T03:05:18Z,2023-11-16T03:05:30Z,4,"I almost cried when Madame Web said<br><br>&quot;As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster. To me, being a gangster was better than being President of the United States. Even before I first wandered into the cabstand for an afterschool job I knew I wanted to be a part of them. It was there that I knew that I belonged. To me, it meant being somebody in the neighborhood that was full of nobodies. They weren’t like anybody else. I mean, they did whatever they wanted. They double parked in front of a hydrant and nobody ever game them a ticket. In the summer when they played cards all night, nobody ever called the cops. Tuddy Cicero. Tuddy. Tuddy ran the cabstand in La Bella Vista Pizzeria and a few other places for his brother Paul who was the boss over everybody in the neighborhood. Paulie might have moved slow, but it was only because he didn’t have to move for anybody.<br><br>At first, my parents loved that I found a job across the street. My father, who was Irish, was sent to work at the age of eleven, and he liked that I got myself a job. He always said American kids were spoiled lazy.And my mother was happy after she found out that the Varios came from the same part of Sicily as she did. To my mother, it was the answer to her prayers.<br><br>I was the luckiest kid in the world. I could go anywhere. I could do anything. I knew everybody and everybody knew me. But it wasn’t too long before my parents changed their minds. For them, the cabstand was supposed to be a part-time job, but for me, it was full-time. People like my father could never understand, but I was a part of something. I belonged. I was treated like a grown-up. Every day I was learning to score. My father was always pissed off. He was pissed that he had to work so hard. He was pissed that he made such lousy money. Be was pissed that there were seven of us living in a tiny house. But after a while, he was mostly pissed that I hung around the cabstand. He said they were bums and that I was a bum. He said I was going to get into trouble. I used to say I was only running errands after school, but he knew better. He knew what went on at the cabstand and, every once in a while, usually after he got his load on, I had to take a beating. But by then, I didn’t care. No matter how many beatings I took, I wouldn’t listen to what he said. I don’t think I even heard him. The way I saw it, everybody has to take a beating some time.<br><br>That was it. No more letters from truant officers. No more letters from school. In fact, no more letters from anybody. How could I go back to school after that and pledge allegiance to the flag and sit through good government bullshit.<br><br>Hundreds of guys depended on Paulie and he got a piece of everything they made. It was tribute, just like the old country, except they were doing it in America. All they got from Paulie was protection from other guys looking to rip them off. That’s what it’s all about. That’s what the FBI can never understand, that what Paulie and the organization does is offer protection for people who can’t go to the cops. They’re like the police department for wiseguys.<br><br>People looked at me differently. They knew I was with somebody. I didn’t have to wait on line at the bakery on Sunday morning anymore for fresh bread. The owner knew who I was with, and he’d come from around the counter, no matter how many people were waiting. I was taken care of first. Our neighbors didn’t park in our driveway anymore, even though we didn’t have a car. At thirteen, I was making more money than most of the grownups in the neighborhood. I had more money than I could spend. I had it all. One day some of the kids from the neighborhood carried my mother’s groceries all the way home for her. It was out of respect.&quot;"

This is doing it backwards and they will lose money again."

@dragonreborn35,2023-11-16T01:36:05Z,2023-11-16T01:36:05Z,0,"Well, Madame Web&#39;s story has been changed and bastardized by woke Hollywood and Sony, just like with Venom. None are these garbage films even relate or come close to the comics, only Toby Maguire and Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies were close as can be to the comics and and they were the good ones. Anything that Sony with Marvel has released after Amazing Spider-Man 2 film has been complete trash including the animated films and games. <br><br>Again, this film is way off and completely different from the original Madame Web you meet in the Spider-Man cartoon. It&#39;s a film no-one asked for or cares for.<br><br>Sony It&#39;s clear you&#39;re taking it from Disney and Marvel under Disney is ruined and sinking, so soon all your Marvel related projects will sink as well. <br><br>Also, take heed, if you destroy, ruin and do Peter Parker the only true Spider-Man, horribly by either killing him, race swapping, gender swapping or whatever woke diversity nonsense change you&#39;re thinking of pulling, you will lose a lot off true fans and consumers."

I&#39;m guessing probably not, if people ditched on Carnage. Hated on Morbius &amp; are already against Kraven then this film has an INCREDIBLY high mountain to climb &amp; with the Official MCU movie&#39;s declining in sales, I can&#39;t see the Sony film&#39;s besides the Spiderverse doing any better.

I have a feeling most people are confused and calling him the dark spiderman or something when hes a well fleshed out interesting and very strong,skilled enemy. I wish it were possible for him to kill all the spider chicks and then  the movie  ends with him stalking peter parker. Who would ever thought that the studio that started the superhero movie boom and high expectations in adaptation of comic book material would all these years later surpass marvels mcu  without even trying cuzits so bad and leave it in the dust i<br> so much more excited for Sonys Spiderverse then anything Marvel/Disney are cooking up and or burning down."

The diverse girl-power team-up, is a choice... but it implies a very limited number of potential storylines, limited writing range, and zero chance of romance; ala the terrible bomb &quot;The 355&quot;. <br><br>(I remember Original spiderman 2002, the kiss between upside down Spiderman and Mary Jane was one of the most romantic scenes in a super hero movie ever.

Tbis is a horrible movie that nobody asked for. <br>    Even worse it gives other movies with female leads a bad rep when Hollywood forces stuff like this.

At least then it would be amusing, and an eight foot tall dude with white hair and a beard who can animorph into a hawk, control souls, and command space time to make carnage into a lawyer for one comic, would be a villain who could get stuff done, and fight a woman who&#39;s whole power set revolves around seeing the future.<br><br>Sims is...he&#39;s not that good. Zeke barely could fight a very sick Peter Parker most times, despite the Spider-Totem powers he had. Heck, Peter had to save HIM during at least one of their fights(Yes yes it was a &#39;test&#39; of Peter being a hero, but it really didn&#39;t seem like he was any better in a fight next time either).<br><br>Anyway, still disappointed Marvel refuses to let Judas into any of these movies...this is not that I like the character, I just want to see him get the snot beat out of him."

Just stick with Spider-Verse, stop trying to create a universe with characters that ultimately service Spider-Man, it doesn&#39;t work and no matter how hard you force it, it&#39;s not going to happen. And you know it&#39;s not going to happen cause everything about this looks and sounds like an amateur fan film because even you have no faith in the project."

Bc Ms. Johnson is good for Indy films bc comes off dead is side on screen.  She’s a great person &amp; actress for what fits her. Sony has a Bree Larson problem. ENOUGH!  All of Sony’s live action superhero movies that don&#39;t involve Marvel creatively have the same 🤬 feel &amp; style of imagery!!!! 😠 The threat doesn&#39;t feel like something menacing enough to warrant real fear from the characters. I feel like I just watched the trailers for Morbius, Venom, Bloodshot &amp; The Amazing Spiderman! There is a spark &amp; missing to get to spend money. 😔 And on another note, these 3 minute movies that take hundreds of millions dollars to make aren&#39;t half bad.  The mystery, surprises, &amp; suspense all gone now. This really saves me the money from watching it in the theaters. 🤦🏾‍♀️ These things wouldn&#39;t piss me off so much if I didn&#39;t like Sony like their ideas. The execution keeps falling short."

No hate towards most of the actresses. <br><br>The Bad:   Most of the  other girls come off as bratty.   Because it is Sony you know that writing is going to be so bad that it is not even worth seeing!   Sony you do not pay your writers enough and you pay your leech executives too much.   You deserve to fail!

@mezxv,2023-11-15T22:11:25Z,2023-11-15T22:11:25Z,0,"I know people are poking fun at the movie but I think it has potential. Im not saying its great, just that it has something interesting. 4 Spider people who arent Peter Parker getting chased by a baddie seems like a fun watch. Worst thing would be if this film was just mediocre. I WANT it to be a little terrible or a little great, not just meh if that makes sense."
@michaelmartinez3893,2023-11-15T22:11:20Z,2023-11-15T22:11:20Z,0,I hate when they show parts of the trailer before the trailer starts. Annoys the crap out of me.
@EduardoMolRom,2023-11-15T22:11:05Z,2023-11-15T22:11:05Z,0,Movie looks so ....boring wtf ....how does this get approved by a review board or committee ...like ??????..so stupid and it WILL flop at the box office

@iRenz0,2023-11-15T22:11:04Z,2023-11-15T22:11:04Z,1,My favorite part is when Madame says “Last chance to look at me Hector” and then proceeds to web him. I got chills.
@drownoble,2023-11-15T22:11:02Z,2023-11-15T22:11:02Z,0,"Umm yeah... another Sony movie that is taking &quot;creative liberties&quot; with a comic character.   You&#39;d think they would learn by now.  So I expect this will be another Morbius level failed attempt at starting a Spider-verse.  They should just stick to the animation films, they are doing much better with those."
@deliciousvegans4505,2023-11-15T22:10:29Z,2023-11-15T22:10:29Z,3,The part where Venom says &quot;no man can stop me&quot; and then Madame Web kicks him in the balls and says &quot;I am no man!&quot; gave me chills.

@alexconsoli5599,2023-11-15T22:08:39Z,2023-11-15T22:08:39Z,0,"Sony Pictures seems to be struggling to retain the Spider-Man license and as a result, they have decided to create a movie based on one of the least popular Spider-Man characters. Rather than partnering with Marvel Studios to produce high-quality Spider-Man movies, they have instead opted for this subpar attempt. It is likely that this movie, as well as Kraven the Hunter, will fail at the box office."

@HyraxusPrimus,2023-11-15T22:08:07Z,2023-11-15T22:08:07Z,0,"I&#39;m going to admit, I think Ezekiel being a Dark Spider-Man and using the Spider-Women in a universe that&#39;s averse to using Spider-Man are good ideas conceptually, but this just looks cheap and awful. <br>Why make it a Madame Web movie instead of just a Spider-Woman movie?<br><br>Also, why don&#39;t they just make The Amazing Spider-Man 3? This universe is begging for the insane Gwen clone saga storyline."

@Luz4SiKio,2023-11-15T21:43:48Z,2023-11-15T21:43:48Z,0,"This trend of modern feminists imbuing every show/movie with toxic femininity has become a problem for us fantasy/sci- fans. And what makes it so much worse is that if we comment about it we&#39;re called misogynists. This needs to stop.<br>         It&#39;s also so extremely hypocritical and devious of them. They have become the very thing they hated in men. The stories used to have great women and men as characters, not this all-woman casting and repeating theme of demeaning men that we&#39;ve seen for years now. Equality would equally represent male and female, not one or the other. This trend is creating more cultural problems than helping.<br>      Hollywood needs to stop lazily shoving their political crap into their productions, because it breaks all emersion and is creating more division and culture wars.  Also, good writers with skill and care can put a parable that&#39;s uplifting for the world into a story and that still have a great plot, world building, and character development. This is just fan fiction surface level writing that uses virtue signaling to attack anyone who critiques it."

Also, what on earth are they doing with Ezekial Sims why is he the villain.

He is instrumental in so many stories to use him as some cheap one off villain is just a waste. He&#39;s the introduction to Silk, Morlun and hell Spider Totems which it seems have something to do with this film. He is also instrumental in kicking off the inheritors aka Spider Verse."

@BevYMoSS,2023-11-15T21:04:31Z,2023-11-15T21:06:15Z,0,Sooo.. Madame Web is just a regular woman in this movie?? And a super random spider woman team up where they all get ther powers at the same time? And somehow none of the 17000 male Spider-Men are involved? And NOBODY knows Peter?  🤮 Like the trailer didn’t even look real. It looked barely better than the Gotham Knights TV show.
@im2tired2sleep,2023-11-15T21:04:30Z,2023-11-15T21:04:30Z,0,the action and effects look cool but the humor and cliche “i can see into the future” jokes are corny

Madam web in the comics is a weird old lady in a stupid chair....Who&#39;s stupid idea was it to make a Spider-Man universe not centered around Spider-Man? Venom kind of worked on its own but still would have been 10x better with Spiderman in it... This is just dumb. Stick to the animated spider verse movies that&#39;s the best thing you guys got going.

I Kinda like they way they are handling her power but the decision  to make Ezekiel sims when he is normally an ally but then again he has been a foe and this makes him more unique to these heroes. I&#39;m more peeved tat she not an elderly woman as that could have been really cool, she could still be active, a seasoned heroin in a timeline where Peter doesnt exist and she&#39;s the OG spider-women but Ezekiel cripples her and blinds her causing her to adapt/learn with the young heroes she&#39;s mentoring,  just a missed opportunity as we don&#39;t see elderly heroes and them taking on that mentorship. <br><br>But the QUALITY just look off, like low budget, fan filmy and that&#39;s really harsh i know but no hate to those who worked on this project but the fact this was shadow dropped to me seems like they just released it for the sake of doing so, but i&#39;ll give Sony credit and some props for actually believing in it, as we&#39;ve seen with WB cancelling movies left and right like Batgirl, and Coyote v ACME."

Where have movies like this been all this time? This must be the first strong female character ever put to film. Surely it will do at least as well as the Marvels. Sony&#39;s DEI rating must be so high right now. I bet their ESG score is through the roof. Don&#39;t worry Sony, one of these days the sinking ship will magically float. &lt;&lt;&lt; SARCASM God has declared war on Hollywood and Disney is the crown jewel, as spoken by a modern prophet in the year 2020."

I&#39;m an ally and all for representation, but there&#39;s a line between having representation and being so over-the-top obvious that you end up drawing attention to it in a negative way instead of positive. I&#39;m not sure if Marvel is ever going to learn this lesson but I guess we&#39;ll see how this does at the box office."

Don&#39;t have her narrate the whole trailer... That shows more than what was needed about the whole movie. Instead, try to limit showing the story and narration which leaves the fans guessing and intrigued to see it. For example, the first scene, Ezekiel Sims, and the girls in their costumes were enough."

@offbrandspider-man1998,2023-11-15T19:04:01Z,2023-11-15T19:04:01Z,1,"It looks so weird, like a okay fan film is a bad big budget movie. Spider woman&#39;s suit looks bad, Ezekiel&#39;s suit looks okay but fan made, the CGI looks bad, the acting seems bland. It looks really weird. The only interesting thing to me is the villain (how he looks and how he fights). Other than that it looks bad. And what&#39;s even more confusing is that Sony can make good spider man stuff( Tobey Maguire movies, spider verse movies.), also kraven looks good but then they do something like this...<br>DO BETTER SONY"

@teodorivanov6185,2023-11-15T18:55:44Z,2023-11-15T18:55:44Z,0,As a true Spider-man fan I must admit that no one cares about these crappy spin-offs from the Spider-man universe unrelated to Spider-man. I mean just give us Spider-man 4 with Tobey and Sam Raimi already!

@alexhayden219,2023-11-15T18:55:22Z,2023-11-15T18:55:22Z,0,"Looks kind of like Final Destination 6: Spiderverse. Probably won&#39;t be good, but I&#39;ll give it a chance. The costumes at least look good, from what I can tell. Hopefully, they do Julia and Anya right, as those are the characters I care about. Though, it seems it&#39;s a complete reimagining of all of them. They&#39;re all around the same age and Adam Scott is playing Ben Parker. Not sure if Peter&#39;s in it at all, but if he is he&#39;ll be young and not Spider-man, while all the Spider-women are already active. IDK. Not high hopes, but we&#39;ll see."

This story is going to be ROUGH!<br>I&#39;m not fond of the trope of using defibrillators in ridiculous ways. That&#39;s so 80s!!!<br>Why does the main villain in the first movie of an IP always have to have the same powers as the heroes!?! Marvel has run this into the ground. <br><br>Pro:<br>That first fight sequence looked good. I&#39;m still a fan of the flipping camera in a fight trope.<br>At least they all look like they&#39;re enjoying themselves in this movie. <br>It&#39;s going to at least be better than Morbius. I&#39;ll take that as a win.

Michael Straczynski with the introduction of Ezekiel Sims and possibly a villain called Morlun. This movie seems like its diverging very far from the original comic origins of these characters though.

BUT, the comic book genre is always generally, mostly male-dominated and male-focused. This movie, and the M-She-U, they are now flooding everyone with female Superheroes, and when people don&#39;t watch them, they will say comic book fans are misogynist or sexists. This movie is like introducing now like 4 female Superheroes at once. Seriously, it is so tiring, they are killing the Comic book genre movies.

I have a pretty good radar of how a movie is gonna be based on the trailer/marketing material and I think this is gonna be a pleasant surprise. I bet a lot of the dialogue here isn’t even gonna be used in the movie (because that’s how Sony rolls). Dakota Johnson looks like she’s gonna be great and some of the action looks surprisingly brutal for a Spider-Man related film. Plus we got a Spider-Man who hasn’t been in any of the films. I’m excited.

@DevineCourage,2023-11-15T17:34:47Z,2023-11-15T17:34:47Z,1,I love the part where Sony keeps making random Spider-Man character movies to hold onto the rights for the Spidey franchise. 🕷️
@CharlieComicsOfficial,2023-11-15T17:34:46Z,2023-11-15T17:35:15Z,1,I thought it looked really bad. And went to the comments on Facebook and they&#39;re all &quot;This looks sooooo amazinggggg!&quot; And I had to come here to make sure I wasn&#39;t crazy. It looks really fake and low budget. And it was a cool concept with Madam Web alone(suspense/thriller type vibe). But I think it&#39;s going to have too much going on with the girls involved. Then they will throw in the suit up and fight scene at the end. Just a prediction but I will keep an open mind. Sony doesn&#39;t have a good track record with these random character movies.

Get her back to the set of 50 shades of grey, women don’t belong in movies like this. They just ruin the potential kf movies, for this one, even their writings and screenplay is trash"

That was classic!!"

@boomstickcritique902,2023-11-15T17:26:27Z,2023-11-15T17:26:27Z,0,Looks decent I have no expectations for these characters or this movie the trailer looks decent but the it looks and feels like a bigger budget fan film at points. This will probally do ok to alright overall at the box office because of its ties to Spiderman and having more Spiderman like characters. I know hardcore MCU fans hate the Sony verse because ita taking characters away from the MCU but for me im fine with them just doing there own lower budget Spiderman spin offs I honestly dont care. I liked both Venom films and Morbius for what I felt like they are 90s feeling messy but entertaining superhero flicks and this looks like more of the same.
@Babbage3,2023-11-15T17:26:25Z,2023-11-15T17:26:25Z,1,A few more quick edits and this will be a good trailer.

There are fanfilms and porn parodies with acting and special effects more convincing than this. What could they have possibly been thinking? Did Sony get their writers from Wattpad? This is sub CW network bad. Fan fiction level bad. It&#39;s so embarrassing. I can not believe this is being released in theaters. Sony... it&#39;s time to stop.

Nobody asked for spin off movies of characters that rely so heavily on Spider-Man, that involve no Spider Man whatsoever. Madame Web, just like Morbius, and Kraven, DO NOT NEED MOVIES. THEY NEED TO BE MAJOR PARTS OF ACTUAL SPIDER-MAN FILMS. Then maybe, if the characters are portrayed good enough, you can do these cash grabs that people actually want."

The problem is that it already seems like there will be too much &quot;twitter &quot; like dialog. Too much Gen Z goofiness and the tone for somethign like this should be more serious. But Marvel loves to make slapstick comedies. Marvel needs to tone down the cringe comedy and get more serious. Especially for a movie like Craven, who is one of spideys best villains."

The music choice for the trailer is a bit weird and doesnt really pump me up.  If they recut this trailer with different music and made the first half more mysterious with more clips of of costumed heros i think itd get people more excited.  I know this is another universe but it feels weird since im going “wheres spiderman? Who is discount spiderman?”

Also, how many times will the film show a scene end poorly and then rewind to a successful outcome? That was getting old half way through the ad and it kind of ruins the tension.

Maybe they aren&#39;t masterpieces but, they are at least more entertaining than the agenda filled garbage that Disney and the MCU continue to push. This is all I want, fun escapism with characters I&#39;ve grown up loving. I don&#39;t need a studio trying to shove it&#39;s politics into everything I watch. I watch movies too escape reality, not be reminded of it."

Looks better than Morbius and that’s saying something. Sony smashed it as per usual.

I guess they can make it unique and she ends up that way at some point but that’s a huge part of her character.

The movie itself and its premise seems intriguing and it could be interesting, but it&#39;s also being written by the guy who wrote Morbius, so we will have to wait and see. That being said, i am still more then willing to give this the benefit of the doubt, due to how cool and interesting the premise is."

@cantstandya9749,2023-11-15T15:02:19Z,2023-11-15T15:02:19Z,0,"This looks awful. Sony, I know you need to keep making Spider-Man related movies to keep the movie rights but please stop these derivative films. We neither need, nor want, Venom, Kraven, Madame Web and Morbius to have solo films. Just make a Spider-Man 4 with Tobey and Raimi and TASM3 with Andrew and Webbs and let them cook. Tobey, Raimi and Kirsten all said they’d be down for Spider-Man 4. So just do it and look at your bank account gain a cool billion+"

Cause Madam Web is more than just some woman who can see the future she’s over all spiderverses and is connected to them all. This really truly looks genuine and awesome. Hopefully it doesn’t flop and hopefully it makes an awesome win. Honestly I wish Venom was a lot more serious and darker but meh at least he’s in the story now.
@JW666,2023-11-15T15:02:01Z,2023-11-15T15:02:01Z,0,I guess Miles Morales is the movie&#39;s villain 😜<br>The villain does look like a Spider-Man version from the Spiderverse or something.

@DarthTingleBinks,2023-11-15T14:56:29Z,2023-11-15T14:56:29Z,0,"This looks even worse than the vignette did. Acting wise, anyway. Also, &quot;My mom was researching Spiders,&quot; is such a dumb way to make the character related to spiders.<br><br>I do want to want to talk about something I&#39;ve seen people say in the comments, though... None of you know what a fan film is. Because this does not look like one. It looks like a bad professional film, but it doesn&#39;t look pike a fan film. So let me educate you.<br><br>1. &#39;Fan film&#39; doesn&#39;t denote or imply a low leve of quality. There are good fan films.<br>2. &#39;Professional film&#39; doesn&#39;t denote or imply a highvlevel of quality. There are bad professional films.<br>3. Typically, the only difference between a fan film and a professional film is production budget. Fan films are more often than not cheaper than professional films, which may or may not be noticeable depending on how well the film was made.<br>4. If you&#39;re calling this a fan film because the acting is bad, then you&#39;re once again using the term &#39;fan film&#39; to denote or imply a level lf quality lower than that of a &#39;professional film&#39;. And again, neither term implies a level of quality in any way. Not in writing, not in acting, not in directing, not in cinematography, etc. The terms can usually be used to denote or imply a vast difference in budget. But not even that is certain as an expensive fan film can be as much as a cheap professional film.<br>5. The only thing you can say for certain is that fan films are made without the backing of any studio, whereas professional films are made with the backing of one or more studios.<br><br>So basically, anyone referring to this as a fan film is clearly retarded."

The strategy worked SOOO well for Morbius (15% rotten).    Venom was dark and &quot;realistic&quot; at times, but still had a lot of humor, and Venom the character came off as quite &quot;animated&quot; instead of always chasing realism.  Chasing a more mass-market appeal is killing these characters and doesn&#39;t end up working at the end of the day.   Honest to God, Morbius looked better than this."

Like those lines, dialogue, and suits all look really low budget but then the camera does some really cool movements or shots that look high budget. Also the same thing goes for this looking like a generic comic book movie to sometimes having Spider Man in it. If you took out the Spider Man suit this would have no correlation to anything related to Spider Man except for webs and spider research. I don’t know, this was just a really weird trailer"
