I mean, the Matrix Resurrection film was obviously purposely made into crap..so maybe this is just a protect by directors now? Or maybe these are tests by the CIA to see how dumb Americans have gotten. Anyone who liked these films is extremely dumb."

Denzel Washington plays a Roman Emperor., Macrinus who reigned from April 217 to June 218 CE. Historically this makes no sense at all, since Macrinus was not black. Blacks were mostly kept as slaves in the Roman Empire and the tight curly hair on the statues is artist license and is easier to make on statues."

Your blood freezes with the cruelty of the scene. The fight scenes in the arena in G2 .... drawn by the hair. Mistakes on the line. The Romans didn&#39;t wear a mustache. The gladiator on the rhino used the bolass - the weapon from South America. Ave Caesar was used as long as the Julian dynasty was, not after. In short - a bad movie, without plot, without plans, emotion and much more."

Его что деньги нужны были сняться в такую дерьмо? Извините что много ругаюсь но я просто очень зол.

Paul Mescal just doesn&#39;t have half the charisma Russel Crowe did and just couldn&#39;t carry the movie. The rest of the performances fell flat. The action scenes try to offer shock value rather than tension, build up and great choreography.

@Hezron-Chaatazarawan,2024-12-31T06:08:22Z,2024-12-31T06:08:22Z,0,"In Gladiator 2, a slave could choose to be a gladiator or entertainer in hope to mitigate his captivity. This is an ancient take on modern day society. Black communities are groomed to believe, to overcome oppression, they must pursue a gladiator derivative(sports) or the entertainment industry(rap). This mindset was casted on black slaves to remain subject to higher powers, preventing revolution by altering a nation’s ambitions of becoming anything more than accepted. <br><br>“A gladiator has his own money to spend”, stated Denzel’s character, Macrinus, while giving his gladiator money in exchange for his loyalty. When a slave receives privileges from his master, he is envied amongst his fellow servants. This strategy is utilized with black athletes of today who receive million dollar contracts, well adulated, yet, are nothing but paraded slaves running in tights and shorts for the appeasement of their white oppressors. <br><br>Ecclesiastes 7:7 Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad; and 👉🏾a gift destroyeth the heart.👈🏾<br><br>Every unrighteous man has a price. For money(gift) he will silence his mind(heart)."

And for Denzel to star in it only proved the weakness of the story / screenplay.  We all knew it.  But we had to see (and they knew it) training day meets Equalizer meets Rome.  Shame shame shame.  /// but then i couldn&#39;t help myself.... I knew it would be bad... but I had no idea how bad.  the worst casting,. some of the worst acting i&#39;ve ever had to endure,... the most predictable and boring screenplay.  the movie barely stands on it&#39;s own merit.  were it not for the above average cinematography the movie would have been a worse flop to my senses.  and for to Denzel running around with his brilliant 2024 pearly white smile --- just gross: shame of casting and shame of him for desecrating the brand with his franchised now predictable gimmick acting (same dude in every movie).   and poor connie just cannot act: they should have un-alived her in the first part of the movie somehow.  The only way this movie could have possibly worked was a script written from a bold, more nuanced shakespearean way - less direct: but there was no way to accomplish this!  certainly this screenplay failed on every level.  Gladiator 2 should be a lesson to both producers, writers, actors and consumers: when the first is global box office and wins on so many levels... leave it alone: for the love of the arts,... leave it alone."

Cow had this brooding, seering hatred yet was mostly a man of few words, somber, calm in most situations not cocky and lighthearted and a brooding persona, it worked beautifully . This new guy kinda seems like Anakin Skywalker in the second film (can’t thinks of a better connection) kinda of cocky and spirited. While Maximus was so obviously living a tortured existence.

@keepwondering_,2024-12-15T01:50:45Z,2024-12-15T01:50:45Z,27,"Best movie i watched this year in cinema. Had me right from the start, man that main character was casted amazing, his wife, everything. The tension of the Romans underneath to each other, these ugly hatefull emperors, they casted them amazing too. The dirty games the recruiter of the gladiator played, the betrayal, the toxic environment. But also the sad slavery live of a gladiator, perfectly captured. The overall feeling of that dark era in history was felt deeply for me, i was sweating through the end of the movie lol. Great job, will check the first one also for sure"

I know it gets a lot of hate for it not being historically accurate but neither was the first movie. if you can put aside historical accuracy and just let yourself enjoy the movie it&#39;s honestly a great watch, the only bad side is the rushed ending for how built out the introduction was for the timeline of 1st movie to the 2nd."

@Howlox,2024-12-08T23:53:13Z,2024-12-08T23:53:13Z,2,"I watched this and I liked it. But, what I will say is it can&#39;t hold a candle to the original. The plot is way too similar but doesn&#39;t make as much sense in this context, the CGI is decent at times (the rhino) and awful at other times (the monkeys that looks like demon or mutants). <br><br>But my absolutely least favourite thing was how hard it tried to reference the original, from them uttering the phrase &quot;strength and honour&quot; to him taking Maximus&#39;s armour and wearing it, him beheading a guy in the exact same way Maximus did (how&#39;d he even remember Maximus doing that?), the movie using so much archive footage from the original, them shoehorning the plot that he had a son with Lucilla (despite the fact that it was not mentioned in the original and kinda undermines the themes of it), lots of shots mimicking the original, the son ordering the other slaves tactically in the exact way Maximus did, etc. etc. I really wish this movie tried harder to be its own thing."

That&#39;s just keeping up with the stereotype that black people, people of color have always been oppressed. they were not. This r4cial discrim1nation as we know it today, started centuries later at a time when a certain group of people from a certain part of the world had a massive superiority complex. before that, people treated each other with relative dignity."

Added to that, it holds too big a place in audiences&#39; hearts. If this sequel referenced the first too little, it&#39;d be a problem. It ended up doing it too much and totally fell in its shadow. And if it did hit a golden medium, the story would have to be incredible too. I still wanted Russell Crowe in it. He is such a HUGE part of what this franchise is and he&#39;s irreplaceable. Maybe the God&#39;s could have sent him back or something and then he lost his memory... only to regain it in a distant land. Then he returns to Rome, older of course, but now he wishes to achieve the dream of Marcus Aurelius. Then he meets Lucius and he has to train him... I could go on and on!!"

Too many characters, practically all of them underwritten, are purely driven by plot motivation. Had it focused more on the relationship between mother and son, and less on imperialistic intrigue, it could have been on a par with it&#39;s predecessor."

I have to find some type of justification for enslaving you so I&#39;ll make up a bunch of BS about you being inferior. Blacks fought in the Colosseum too. You could start as a slave fighting in the Colosseum and work your way up to high positions in rome. One even became a general.

Ridley Scott knows how to deliver on spectacle without sacrificing an incredibly moving story. My spouse was dabbling his eyes at the end, saying it was perfect. From the exciting opening naval scene, to the wild animals, and ferocious arena scenes, the way the original flashbacks tie into the current story is beautifully done. Denzel Washington was mesmerizing. Pedro Pascal played his role perfectly; I was wishing he had more screen time.  Paul Mescal delivered incredible fight physicality and heartbreaking pain. I loved it. Easily the best movie I’ve seen in years."

@IndieVolken,2024-11-18T04:51:30Z,2024-11-18T04:51:30Z,0,saw a bunch of comments - am guessing aimed at casting of Denzel Washington = now to be clear am as opposed to virtue signalling / tokenism as anyone as does my head in ; but the character that he plays  - &quot;Macrinus&quot; was born in what is now Algeria ; with a Berber background - so where its unlikely to be anything like how Denzel Washington looks ; is possible some ethnic background

It&#39;s a coastal city by the Mediterranean, and most of the people have white or tan skin. Even in the local museum, you can see statues, mosaics, and artifacts that show the people who lived there had predominantly white or tan features, not black. But personally, I think Denzel Washington is a great actor. I don&#39;t see any problem—white or black doesn&#39;t make a difference if the actor knows how to embody the character.

@AryanAleviZaza,2024-11-11T14:28:07Z,2024-11-11T16:13:04Z,0,"Africa is not a homogeneous continent. North Africa, populated by Mediterranean-type populations, is clearly cut off from black Africa by the largest desert in the world: the Sahara. We cannot therefore say that all of Africa is a black continent<br>. You have to have a little common sense, a little logic so that the public can immerse themselves in the story. We cannot therefore choose, for example, a white actor like in the 50s and 60s to play, for example, the king of an African tribe, or a Chinese or Japanese emperor, whatever the talent of the actor in question, and the reverse is also true. It is a question of maintaining a minimum of coherence, especially when it is a film that deals with a historical period. It is true that for this film the problem does not stop only with the character of Denzel Washington and that Ridley Scott seems to have taken a lot of distance from historical reality (Gladiator had also taken some distance from history but despite all these &quot;liberties&quot; seemed credible and was counterbalanced by a powerful script rigor, which does not seem to be the case here). We are witnessing here an excessive Disneylandization, that is to say that we can do everything and its opposite without worrying about coherence and logic. Nothing matters, everything can be done and its opposite. It is no longer cinema but a circus, a huge show machine without a soul. You have to be devoid of culture and historical knowledge to find nothing wrong with it, maybe this film is aimed primarily at an American viewer."

The Disney re-makes are also gaining controversy because they&#39;ve all been said and done before, and it&#39;s all so cheesy.

He made it Lengendary. He made it Unmatched . Its just the truth . No sequel was needed. We understood and appreciated the passion and flow of emotions and energy Russel and team created . Gladiator  is remembered  in our hearts as was . Somethings .. doesnt have a continuation. And as especially  one that.has a totally different  aura as this !  Somethings we respect it enough ..to leave it alone.

Going back and making pointless sequels and prequels to movies that already ended perfectly. Personally think he’s out of ideas. Don’t see why he feels the need to go back and mess about with previous projects so much. The film looks visually stunning, but then again, so did ‘Prometheus’ and ‘Alien: Covenant’ and we all know how that went…"

@themangomanjuice,2024-08-22T20:27:24Z,2024-08-22T20:27:24Z,2,I was very curious when I first read online that this forever timeless classic of mine was getting a sequel. Very cool to see this classic get a sequel. I always loved that the original movie released the year I was born. I have always been very captivated by all movies and various media released in the year 2000 due to it being my birth year.

So you have a problem with the music for the trailer but it’s not the music but the group of people it is attributed to blacks the same blacks that created Rock and Roll but don’t worry music for the trailer isn’t usually on the soundtrack.

Ridley Scott … please stop indulging yourself in these terrible ideas.  Do better!  “The Duelists” … great … do better with less.  Not do worse with more.  And stop using actors who have no business portraying characters in the period films you’re making.  Do better!  Or tell different stories with the actors you want to work with.  History is exciting.  It doesn’t need to be “rebooted”.  Cut it out.  Find the right story.

More Blacks certainly would have been in the Roman world either as slaves, or even won their freedom and risen up into public society. Historical fact.  I really hate the British voices too. Why am I so critical? I been a fan of gladiator films since the 1960s and have seen every single one - which I am sure the writers, director and producers have also. They need to pay attention to the details.<br><br>The CGI is really noticeable also which is annoying.  I do like the rhinoceros though. Really cool bit.

But he needs roles in black historic stories, aren’t there any sagas from Africa which can be made in the movie, Bantu expansion alone can be made into a dozen movies.

@hhsamcox,2024-08-15T22:22:42Z,2024-08-15T22:22:42Z,1,"After reading over 100 comments it&#39;s clear that some people are clearly invested in &quot;whiteness&quot; when the ancient Romans and Greeks at the time of the Gladiators were clearly an interethnic society. Why not interracial, because there is only one race, the human race, and what we know as &quot;whiteness&quot; is an invention of colonial America that went sideways over time. The ancient Greeks who founded so-called Western Civilization had no qualms about admitting that everything they knew was learned at the feet of Black/Kemetan scholars and scribes. Your Eurocentric educational system is being exposed for the indoctrination machine it is versus an accurate representation of historical world events. Grow up, Google the autobiographies of the ancient Greeks and Romans of history using the translation features available to everyone and see what the truth is. Can you handle it or do you need your fairy tales/lies/myths of whiteness to survive on a level playing field?!"

This other thing is not able to compete. It will only destroy the legacy of Ridley Scott&#39;s greatest success. That guy had been chasing that same success since and clearly has not found it. This new film truly shows how desperate he is to have one more big hit before he dies. Sadly for the rest of us, it ruins the original forever and dismantles Ridley Scott as a top director and show him more as a guy willing to sell his legacy off, not to mention his fans, and try for one more big blockbuster. Special effects do NOT make a great story. Cant wait for Hollywood to fail already so we can get back to great and original story&#39;s. Not just theme park rides. Yet another downfall for Hollywood and this formerly visionary director."

@arontung,2024-08-13T18:39:23Z,2024-08-13T18:39:23Z,1,Denzel character Macrinus was an African born in Algeria. ancient  Rome was not like Hollywood woke whitewashing movies that you grew up with. That’s a fantasy. There was free African people &amp; emperors walking around in the empire. Whiteness wasn’t a thing back then. So if it’s that way you identify you won’t find anything about that in Ancient Rome.

Some say that Romans should be reimagined as having a variety of skin tones, and that Black people were not just slaves or servants. Harvard University Press&#39;s Blacks in Antiquity cites evidence from literary and archeological sources that shows Black Africans were known as warriors, diplomats, athletes, and performers, and were not primarily considered slaves."

So  that’s why I think Gladiator II might surprise us.

@a.thomas9734,2024-08-11T14:22:42Z,2024-08-11T14:22:42Z,0,"I will say what i did like about this trailer. The reveal of the coliseum being filled with water for fights between ships (i was really hoping if they made a sequel that they would do this), and the Rhino. If they had paired this trailer with a different, less off the wall song, and didnt overstuff it, it could have generated alot of excitement. The rap song and some of the dialog really undermined this trailer. Especially the rap song. Theres a reason why 90% of these comments are bashing this trailer over it. It shows hollywood desperately trying to make the trailer seem hip in the most misguided way possible. This is a movie about ancient rome for f*cks sake lol. Putting the trailer to rap music is ridiculous, and most people can see right through it. It&#39;s almost condescending to the average intelligence of viewers. Like &quot;hey, we are hip, here&#39;s some rap music&quot;. Lol"

It looks like following the death of Commodus,  there were tumultuous events in Rome, particularly among the elite; a lethal power grab in which either Lucilla told Lucius to go into hiding and deny who his parents were, or Lucius realised by himself he would have to, to survive. Lucius is, after all, the grandson of Marcus Aurelius and therefore descended from Roman Royalty."

@AlfredMontbank,2024-07-25T12:49:35Z,2024-07-25T17:51:34Z,0,"Rap to promote a classic Roman Empire movie? Really? <br>Would it make sense to play Techno music in the background in a film set up back in the old Maya society? Or some Flamenco music when presenting a Lord of the Rings film? What about either some soft Enya or some chill out music when presenting a action gang film? <br>Paramount Pictures, not a indie company, well established. <br>I believe any art may use some poetic license, to make greater the art itself, but not to the point it corrupts the art. <br>Do we ask ourselves how we come to this. Pushing and pushing something that doesnt make sense into becoming common, normal. I wont watch this film on cinema for sure. I am not paying and helping nonsense to spread. Maybe in few years I will watch it on one of the channels we already have. <br>Ps. I cant wait to see Last of the Mohicans 2, being presented maybe by some Reggea, or perhaps Rammstein? 🤣🤣"

@spyrofan86,2024-07-25T00:40:48Z,2024-07-25T00:40:48Z,0,I’m definitely gonna see this movie cause my question is when it comes to the storyline is we know about Russell Crowe‘s character dying at the end of the movie and the Emperor as well but my question is this I’m just wondering how they’re going to work on the storyline when it comes to the son because we know that Rome hated the emperor
@TheSuirad,2024-07-25T00:40:36Z,2024-07-25T00:40:36Z,2,I&#39;m just hoping Denzel is playing a villain again.
