You don&#39;t find yourself feeling sorry for Megatron, but you understand why he&#39;s so angry, why he feels the way he feels and why he believes he&#39;s the fit ruler for Cybertron. He really goes down a dark and heartbreaking path to become the monster we all know him as now."

@kellyw976,2024-12-01T14:03:27Z,2024-12-01T14:39:04Z,3,"(Please note: this is a very, very long comment, like an essay. If you&#39;re not in the mood to read a long comment then please feel free to skip it. Thank you! )<br><br>I grew up in the &#39;80s and watched the entire original Transformers series and then some. Admittedly, I didn&#39;t watch most of the other Transformers movies or the other series that came later, and here are my thoughts on this movie, which I watched recently. It had a lot of really great things going for it, but also some things that really could have been done so much better. I loved the humor, there were parts where I had to pause the movie just to get all the laughter out of my system. It was a really cool idea to have Optimus Prime and Megatron start out as best friends, and I loved the way Starscream and the others were introduced, and Elita One and Bumblebee&#39;s central roles. (This is very nerdy, but Bumblebee was my first crush, I was maybe five or six at the time? Haha. So that&#39;s very nerdy but he&#39;ll always be special to me for this reason, and they portrayed him so wonderfully in this film). I thought the way the rivalry and general dynamic between D-16/Megatron and Starscream was introduced was excellent, and I loved how they depicted the way that Megatron&#39;s cannon made its first appearance, that was so well done. But some things... could have been done so much better considering the richness and quality of the story overall. <br><br>Please note: the following couple of paragraphs contain criticisms that I have of this movie (including SPOILERS); however, I want to emphasize again that I enjoyed it overall and thought there were some amazing things about it; maybe because I had found it to be very good I held it up to very high standards, and so I was disappointed where I felt it could have done better. If you feel that you will not be happy reading criticisms of this movie then, again, please feel free to stop reading here.<br><br>I feel like they kind of rushed into some things because they really wanted to get to a certain point in the plot, and they didn&#39;t allow enough time for certain dynamics and emotions to feel believable. For example, I feel like the transition from Orion Pax and D-16 going from best friends to enemies happened too fast and didn&#39;t feel credible; really, the change in personality in D-16 didn&#39;t feel credible in the short amount of time it was granted, even considering his motive. It just didn&#39;t feel convincing. Or like how quickly Starscream&#39;s followers relinquished their loyalty to him and rapidly switched to D-16 instead, it happened too quickly to feel credible. And especially the part toward the end where Orion Pax actually took a hit for Sentinel Prime - I felt like this was going too far, like I get that Orion would be against wanting to destroy and kill (like D-16 wanted), but actually standing in the line of fire to take a hit for Sentinel Prime, it felt like too much. I feel like taking a hit/risking your life is more something very personal that you would do for someone you deeply care about and love, it didn&#39;t feel like it fit for that situation. Especially since afterward Orion apparently had no qualms blasting D-16/Megatron with his hardest hit. You might say &quot;oh but D-16 betrayed him by throwing him down (which also didn&#39;t feel like something he would credibly do), so supposedly that would justify why later in their fight Orion had blasted D-16 so readily - but it didn&#39;t have a feel of him hurting from a deep betrayal, which would show more conflict in him, an inner battle of love for his former best friend and the pain that the betrayal carried. Like Orion actually risked his life for Sentinel Prime but then not long after he easily blasted his former best friend with his most powerful hit... it just didn&#39;t feel believable to me. The writers could have done so much better. <br><br>Also I feel like the part where D-16 just let Orion fall into the abyss after he took the hit, that also didn&#39;t feel credible to me: like this person had been your best friend for such a long time, and then without any qualms you&#39;d just let him fall to his doom, it was too much. He should have been shown to go through more conflict and turmoil, like even as angry as he felt, he wouldn&#39;t be able to just drop him. I felt like the writers were so eager to get to the point of an established rivalry between Optimus Prime and Megatron that they made everything go too fast to where it wasn&#39;t believable. Also like... I get that the original Transformers was intended for boys (even if I was a female who liked it as a kid and as an adult), and so most of the important characters were male-- but it still feels kind of crappy that even though Elita-1 is important in this film (one of the only two important females...) she still for some reason voluntarily takes second seat to Orion Pax and fangirls about his glory, where her greatest accomplishment is being second to him-- even though that doesn&#39;t make sense either if presumably she started out being ahead of him. But I get that if they did this differently, then fanboys would complain that they&#39;re &quot;changing it to make it &#39;woke&#39; and give females importance where it wasn&#39;t there originally,&quot; like how they complained about four female Ghostbusters - instead of saying that the original should have given females more importance in the first place, considering that we also liked watching it). Same with Airacnid: if she is so amazing then why is she so eagerly serving Sentinel Prime instead of being the important leader herself... <br><br>And speaking of which, I feel like Orion/Optimus&#39; personality also changed a little too fast, from kind of a good-hearted rascal to this big commanding leader. It would have been more realistic to have him and Megatron both feel more conflicted about the relationship between them, and maybe fumble around with the new power of being a leader-- maybe feel that the responsibility was too heavy all at once, since neither of them really had prior experience leading... The way the ending was done was a little corny, I just feel like the writers were so eager to get to this point of &quot;and this is how dynamics were in the original Transformers series, and now you saw how it became that way&quot; -  that they rushed toward it and then made some kind of cheesy scenes in the end of &quot;I am Optimus Prime&quot; etc. Was it still a good movie? Yes, I liked it and enjoyed watching it a lot, it had a lot of fantastic things going for it. I was really hoping that at the very end there would be some hilarious scene where Bumblebee does something stupid and it makes his horns pop out, but unfortunately that never happened - but they did include a funny scene with Bumblebee at the end, so that was cool."

It was a good movie but a lot of youtube videos blame the first trailer and the marketing for the bad box office for ransformers one.

First of all, I didn&#39;t even remember this film, and I only remembered a little bit from when it was announced before the trailers, and look, I like the franchise, now imagine someone who doesn&#39;t follow transformers, besides that this trailer is terrible, it made it seem like the movie would be Mid when it is basically the best movie in the franchise, I hope we get a continuation"

@YourAwarriorHereToConquer,2024-11-21T17:49:59Z,2024-11-21T17:49:59Z,3,Movie was 9/10 (movie is too short should’ve made atleast 4 of these movies like Star Wars plus my favorite s cons were shown weak) other than that the movie was great.

I was skeptical about the movie at first but I must say one of the best transformers I&#39;ve ever seen. The whole family watched and it is simply amazing.  Can&#39;t wait for the next one.

Humour was good, actiob sequences cool, setting extravagant. Second time seeing Starscream as a small time lord  (he was in a game) and not a total wimp, and D 16 slowly turning. May differ from comic origins but still a fun movie."

Now it all make sense why in the movie magnetron says in a fight to prime “We were friends once” this is the back story of why magnetron have a desire to kill prime and take over cibatron  I absolutely love this movie If you are a transformers fan you definitely love this one and don’t hesitate watch it because its just animation rather than a real movie this is by far the best one The plot is amazing also I love B even more after this haha B is always my fav even in real movies also Optima’s love everything about them also the bound✨"

You have no idea how long lve been waiting for a Transformers movie with actual no humans or Earth but just Transformers and nothing else. Like it should always have been in first place. And now lm so completely excited for what it has to come in the future l can barely express it with words. So you just go ahead and make THIS from now on you hear me?

All enjoyed but I do think that Peter Cullen should have been the voice when he became Optimus Prime. I don’t care what anyone says it just isn’t right when it’s not him. Also, Megatron’s voice was absolutely shockingly way off. Completely wrong. Was fine for the D16 character but when his eyes turned red it should have been Frank Welker with his metallic one.

@Taleen_matar11,2024-09-15T14:03:18Z,2024-09-15T14:03:18Z,1,I watched it today idk how but ima spoil it so the prime dude the blue and red and his friend the grey one and some pink one her name is elita and a yellow one all 4 try to deafeat their leader or king or whatever he’s like blue and gold they wanna expose him because he was lying to the citizens or whatever that he took the thing in their chest that makes them transform or whatever and he also forces them to mine so these  4 found out and then the grey who is friends whith the prime guy betrays him and basically kills him and then prime gets the thing they were looking for idk I forgot what it was called it’s basically a thing in these transformers chest and then becomes powerful and becomes the ruler or king with the help of his two friend elita and the yellow annoying guy who never stops talking (I know this wasn’t very clear but I watched the whole thing early in the cinema and it was THE BESTTTTT soooo nice but the ending was so sad and left my jaw dropped but it was actually the best movie I ever watched )

When Beast Wars and Tf Animated came out, everyone hated it, but look at both of them now, they are both amazing and great. And it’s nice for a franchise to try something new and bold. And it can end negativly of course, but it can also turn out to be great and Beast Wars and Animated Proved it."

It need to feel for techno robot. I’m literally only going by what I’ve seen but it plays out way too basic a premise thus far.

@PandoMatic,2024-06-19T09:26:15Z,2024-06-19T09:26:15Z,0,"The TF: Prime backstory to me was the most appealing for Megatron and Optimus. I liked how both were good friends, but as Optimus was chosen as the rightful wilder of Matrix of Leadership. Megatron became evil and created divide of Autobots and deceptions. Which ruined Cybertron."
@prometheusvenom7189,2024-06-18T08:31:36Z,2024-06-18T08:31:36Z,0,I know there’s a lot of skepticisms with this film but we have to remember Orion (really Optimus Prime under a different alias to denounce his heritage as the last Prime) both him and Megatron (a shorter name for Megatronous Prime the Fallen) were friends before the war. It’s a funny movie for the fandom. Besides at least these guys are respecting the lore can’t say the same for Lucasfilms.
