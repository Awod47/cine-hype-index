@EncrustedLionHeart,2024-07-07T20:18:33Z,2024-07-07T20:18:33Z,2,I just watched it. I was mad everytime I&#39;d see on Prime. I just knew it was going to be a crappy remake. It was fn amazing! New crush unloaded Jake😍 😩 Just how my mom was about Patrick😂 Also I had a feeling dude wasn&#39;t dead. I&#39;d say I can&#39;t wait for another but there is really no point unless Dad gets out of prison and creates another gang with Greggor looking for a rematch. That was a real hero vs villian fight and I fn loved it! Glad I finally watched this treasure 😊

@UT9-fu3qj,2024-07-04T15:08:57Z,2024-07-04T15:11:56Z,2,"One of the worst movies I have watched. This should be classified as comedy, not action. The actors know that they are acting, and yet they pretend to act. There is no seriousness in the acting. You cannot integrate with the events of the movie because you know that it is cheap acting. There is no realism or integration with the events. It is a boring movie. 0 out of 10."

He personality did not fit, his cheesey lines he says mid fight while he&#39;s getting beat up. This was a fcking joke. Literally. They ruined one of the greatest movies of all time. The only reason why is did so good upon release was because it was Connor McGregor first film. Just like his fights he sells them. I cannot believe I was excited to watch it. It makes me sick. I mean killing people and leaving them in coolers, nahhh that&#39;s not road house. This movie should have never been remade. Patrick swayze is turning in his grave right now. That lead actor makes me sick seeing him in this"

Yes, the original is a silly 80s movie, but it is what it is. This one tried to be all things to all people. <br><br>He has a back story that is hinted at but never fully developed. Yep, a love interest that leads nowhere. <br><br>A badly crafted so-called emotional hook with the young teenage girl he meets, which is as thin as a sheet of bible paper. <br><br>The woman who owns the bar who hired him seems to be an afterthought, and how many seconds can they have her in it just to remind the audience to why he is there originally. <br><br>Every character is less than one dimensional. It seems as though the main star is going through the motions as if he was somehow obligated to do that film 🤔. Putting just enough effort into getting out of bed to make it to the set on time. <br><br>Then Conor turns up, playing a parady of himself with so-called dialogue that would be classed as Shakespearean in the world of chimps. <br><br>They also tried to make him funny with a little quip here and there. <br><br>It has special effects on the fight scenes. The question is why. Even those are clearly  clunky as though they wanted to do away with actual stunt men. <br><br>Does start with potential but a quick steep drop into terrible."

Though it looks like most movies being released these days. A over use of action with no substance. Why so many remakes though? Oh yea, Too many people sitting in board rooms lacking tallent who make all the decisions. Who lack the skill to create movies so good that future generations would want to create remakes of. Relying on hits from the past in hopes to make a quick buck off of."

He has great acting potential and should of been given more lines and more depth to his character which i believe he could of quite easily portrayed. I hope to see him in other movies .

@DIDYOUSEETHAT172,2024-04-10T19:13:55Z,2024-04-10T19:13:55Z,0,"It ain&#39;t Shakespeare, but it sure is fun. SPOILERS sort of. Excellent cinematography, the gags are top notch. I served in the Special Forces, I don&#39;t watch many action / war movies, I always get disappointed by the choreography, and especially scenes where there is the detonation and the hero calmly strolls away. Or takes out all the bad guys while they stagger around. When Dalton detonates the IED on the boat, gets blasted off his feet, hearing goes all wonky, he is disoriented. That is how it goes. Feels like you get kicked in the chest, and your brain is getting sucked out of your nose, hearing. Fights scenes top notch. Franchise anyone? Haven&#39;t seen Jake Gyllenhaal movies since The Day after, fun. 👍"

This movie was at best weak scripted, and outside of Jake and the comedian woman, poorly cast and the weakest script ever. Conor McGregor doesn&#39;t belong in any movie, trash script, awfully directed and Jake is only mediocre. Patrick Swayze rolling over in his grave and Sam Elliot rolling his eyes on this one. Music was super weak as well- how did this even get made?"

It lacks any of the charm the old movie had. Mcgregor is not an actor. He walked around like he had something stuffed up his butt the whole time. It wasnt scary or intimidating it was just weird. I know he acts all over the top when he fights and stuff but it was just silly.

Those guys were true actors and they&#39;re all either gone or just about finished.The future of movies is in the shitter.... When we have to start relying on b. S overrated UFC fighters like Connor McGregor Tito Ortiz Randy coltoure and rampage Jackson as actors. That basically means the movie business.  Is done...."

The idea that everyone would just start fighting anybody because there&#39;s a bar fight is stupid. And the band just keeps playing is so unrealistic. People climbing up to the vaulted ceiling for what reason? And Jake&#39;s character, who&#39;s been invincible, is now a mediocre fighter. Just bad writing."

Swayze would of be proud!.... McGregor played a part that he is like in real life (with a dash of villianism 😂 which was Perfect for his role!. The fight scenes were good. I though it would of gotten ruined by too much CGI but it was captured well.  4) great mix of action and humour.    Also, ps. From the get-go I love the homage to the original road house where Dalton got stabbed in the stomach (same area in both movies) and he met his fling there. Movie was so good I paused in mid-way, ordered UberEats popcorn so I can really enjoy the second half. Overall: 7.4/10"

Not throwing punches all day all night. Julia Lynch was gorgeous.. And ohh boy Denise Michaels.. Wasn&#39;t she full and something. They kept it simple like a small town rivalry but a bloody one. Not like all going on in the world is a road house rivalry, as if its an international event. <br>I know I would miss all that in this version or Roadhouse."

The script was risible, the plot badly developed and the details essentially make no sense. Why put a guy&#39;s body on ice in your own boathouse if you were just going to leave it there? At least feed it to the Alligator. The post credit bit with McGregor was pathetic. To think this is the same guy who made the first Bourne film, Mr and Mrs Smith and Edge of Tomorrow; how the mighty have fallen. BAD."

Then Road house 3 we see Dalton as the lead who calls in Garrett for help like the original, an Jake Gyllenhaal&#39;s Garrett dosent die exactly.. but gets hurts badly, and settles with a Bar owner. Then We might get a #4 with just Dalton, where he is a bit older an the Best &quot;cooler&quot; who takes a job, an recognizes a bouncers talent like Garrett did in him, so he helps him become better.. End of movie and End of sequel. Unless a #5 is a rinse, wash Repeat, with a twist.

The only issues were,  the way the camera Try to avoid The Ghost punching.  Or the shadow punching...the camera Must took the shot from behind  thats was done too many times.<br><br>3.not able to carry acting  seriously and theres no Second Thought  to  deliver good action.<br><br>For instance.  the Scene jake was stabbed and a woman approached him ,  the Character wasnt behave In the Normal way people React..<br>She Was tooo Calm  in a  stabbing Situation.<br>As if it was  something Not A Life Threatening Situation.<br>The Director can Make Another Take To Get Better performance.   Jake and Connor  acted well.   Jake being a pro Actor... hes Good ..<br>And Connor, being The Notorious.. Its Suits The Film.  <br><br>Congrats to Road House."

Jake is a stunning man it was good to see him throwing hands in this movie I wasn&#39;t sure he could pull it off but he did really good. <br>also when all these comments say that Coner&#39;s role in this movie was so much like his real personality that you can&#39;t even tell he&#39;s acting at all is very true youll see why when you watch the movie but 11/10 would recommend

That would be like remaking Hitchock&#39;s Psycho.  (Case in point).  The best this movie can do is to be almost as good as the original. But, even with all the CGI and location shooting in Dominican Republic, you can never duplicate the charm of the original.  Here&#39;s an idea: And Disney, are you paying attention?

But....that&#39;s not a bad thing :)<br><br>Notice: Do NOT watch this movie expecting &quot;old&quot; RoadHouse....this is a re-imagining of it, a different story. You could even call it &quot;alternate universe&quot;.<br><br>The action was much better than i expected and Connor MacGregor MADE this movie just as much as Jake Gylenhall did. My guess was that they had to train Macgregor &quot;not&quot; to knock Jake out by accident more than acting lessons . LOL This had one very &quot;no holds barred&quot; fights and a bunch of smaller fights.<br><br>Yes, they take a few quotes from the old movie....but that&#39;s it. So, again, don&#39;t expect the &quot;old&quot; movie.<br><br>It has a realy &quot;Florida Keys&quot; vibes but i really don&#39;t know &quot;where&quot; they filmed it.<br><br>But yeah, totally worth the watch. It could have been an early 2K movie but Hollywood is losing it&#39;s touch so lots goes to streaming channels.<br><br>Lol, you can tell that Joke didn&#39;t &quot;memorize&quot; a lot of movies that Patrick Swayze made.

However, the writing was questionable and the acting overall was pretty B-movie. There were times when I assumed they were trying to be &quot;corny like the original&quot; and so, fair enough, but whatever their intention was, I would have preferred they just try to make a good overall movie. You can have nods to the original, and some &quot;corny&quot; elements AND still have good writing. Harder and harder to find these days, though. At least it wasn&#39;t LOTR:ROP. ;)"

@wexfordrob,2024-03-23T11:20:40Z,2024-03-23T11:20:40Z,2,This would’ve been a straight to vhs movie back in the 80s. Gyllenhall is probably the most feeble sounding tough guy in Hollywood history. Not to mention his ridiculous weirdo smile. He’s great in zodiac and nightcrawler but he Just doesn’t suit this part.
@bigmoney4685,2024-03-23T11:20:02Z,2024-03-23T11:20:02Z,2,Everyone bashing mcgregors acting when theres actors on tv and in hollywood worse than him. His debut was ok for the movie it was replace mcgregor with any other actor and the movies the same it will never be as good as the original.

This movie is utter garbage &amp; Conor&#39;s over-acting regardless of it being his first movie was a hard watch, embarrassing &amp; cringe worthy. This movie should be avoided at all costs unless you wanna waste a couple hrs of your life &amp; if that&#39;s your thing then this is definitely the movie for you! Summing up..

The screenwriters give the impression that they have never been to South Florida or out of LA for that matter. It&#39;s insulting to the culture, the people of the keys, and law enforcement. Childishly written, lacking any imagination, feels as if the screenwriters had a fixation with the Avengers series. Should have been called Pu**y House. Dirtbike badasses, Hawaiian shirt spring breakers, and whiney daddy boys. If they had any understanding of South Florida there would have been a shootout and the movie would have been over in the first 10 Min. Go ahead, see what happens when you grab me. ;-) Peace. Also, it&#39;s a MOVIE, not a film. IMDB and Wikipedia really need to get their act together. We do not film or make films unless you are using something like an ARRIFLEX 435 or shooting with Super 8.  Digital Video and film require different skill sets and gear, having different historical and technological timelines spanning 150 years. :-) We work with Digital Video, Non-linear, and CGI. Have pride and show some knowledge of the technology we use. Peace. :-)"

Why were all the bad guys just dumb comic relief. Conor was the biggest cartoon character. He was a joke.

Some missing scenes like checking on the book store family, and making that a real part to be pissed off about.

@mb0i321123,2024-03-22T09:50:15Z,2024-03-22T09:50:15Z,0,It’s a great movie to Watch. I am a little dissapointed in some of the fight scenes though. It dosent feel like a real fight but super scripted (which because it’s a movie it obviously is) but what I mean is they don’t fight like you would in a street fight. It’s more the classic movie fight with I punch you and you punch me. <br>I will say Gratz to Conor for not tapping in the end 😂
@yun1k,2024-03-22T09:48:53Z,2024-03-22T09:48:53Z,0,And again I was able to see the entire plot of the movie in the trailer

What&#39;s the point of this?? There&#39;s no charater development, so we&#39;re just gonna assume who is who: who&#39;s the hero, the bad guy, the love-interest. It&#39;s like a Steven Seagal movie at this point! And Gyllenhaal basically just smiles and does some stupid mma moves. At least the original had some heart, and tried to be a movie, this is just like a joke. Hey, look mom! we made a parody of an 80&#39;s action flick!"

I  was so excited to check this movie out. should have known  better you can remake a master piece . this movie sucks. swazey is  turning in his grave. so disappointed remakes never capture the original master  piece  guess thats why they wait 40 some years to  show this garbage

Connor looks too coked out; his character just does not have any sense other than a bloke being on coke permanently. The bad guy though I think that actor would make a hell of a Bond villain."

A story that is weak because it isn&#39;t written deeply enough for you to feel anything about the characters. The CGI kills any expectations of real stunts being done and are so obvious it looks like an Xbox game. This movie has nothing at all to do with the original Road House. How are remakes that are uncomfortably different than the original allowed to call them by their original title?!? Horrible movie and an insult to the original. Amazon should credit us $20 to watch this garbage."

I thought it would be amazing because nowadays they have so much money for movies but this was a total mess. Jake Gyllenhaal must have been paid a fortune to star in this because his movies are always fabulous. This isn&#39;t something he should be proud of. The script is absolute garbage. McGregor&#39;s role is to be a clown which he pulls off.

Roadhouse was done to the measure it was done with Patrick Swayze. It never needed to be redone and just moved to the beaches of Florida. They even copied the script.

It’s a good way to pay homage to Patrick Swayze and I think McGregor makes a great bad guy and antagonist whatever you wanna call it but I just can’t see Jake Gylenhall beating the shit out of Conor McGregor 😂😂 hard to wrap my head around that one even in a flick

Dalton (and the whole movie) was great because of the complexity of character that Swayze demonstrated with his amazing performance. Jake seems way out of his wheelhouse with this role.

You can&#39;t have Dalton be a UFC fighter as his whole thing was no one knew who he was and were always amazed how small and polite he was. If he was UFC fighter then a lot of people would know all about him. It is realistic in the fact he&#39;s doing bouncer work though as Dana White is notorious for only paying the very top 0.000001% of his fighter a decent wage and everyone else destroys themselves physically and mentally for next to ZERO pay! Plus even these few top 0.000001% only have a well earning career for a few short years before crippling injuries or being past it rules them out.

Crowded. Key West is like a big outdoor bathhouse. Miami Cubans all over. If you want to lose yourself on an island your friends haven&#39;t been to, go to the east side of Andros. Stay away from the west side if you want to live."

This actually looks pretty good amd of course im sure it wont be nearly as great as the original but im all for this movie. A few things i notice is Jake doesnt seem to embody the role nearly as well as Swayze but Jake is one of the most likeable actors and he looks phenominal and he will do justice to the role made famous by Swayze. Connor looks to be a great fun villain. One of my favorite aspects of the original was Brad Wesley,one of the best villains in the 80&#39;s. I think this movie will be really good and a fun watch."

Hardly any mention or nod to Patrick. Much loved and missed. I think Pat would love this as much as i do from the trailer.

We needed a younger Tom Hardy or Jason Statham type actor for this classic character. I would say even Zac Efron could have encompassed the mysterious, serious, witty trash talking yet professional character Dalton is without coming off as awkward, goofy, unrelaxed, alpha geek-like that I get from Gyllenhaal. He misses the mark even in the short trailer here. Just not it."

I was highly skeptical of a remake, even though I usually enjoy Jake Gyllenhaal. I knew he could do the action, but I doubted he could really replicate Swayze&#39;s zen Dalton. I&#39;m really glad that&#39;s not what they tried to do. It seems like they are inspired by the original without trying to outdo it or redo it. At least from the trailer, it looks like a fun homage to a classic. Not all remakes are trash. <br><br>I think it was smart to lean into Gyllenhaal&#39;s innate sarcasm. I think McGregor is a fucking lunatic and it looks like he&#39;s essentially playing himself here, so... good casting lol. I&#39;m open-minded about this after seeing the trailer. And Liman is right to be pissed at Amazon. This definitely deserves to be in theaters. It looks like exactly the kind of movie I would pay to go see in person. Total popcorn and friends flick."

When you think of the original road house you immediately think 80’s and round house kicks <br><br>Hollywood still doesn’t have the balls to take a chance on something original so they’re still remaking every single movie that was decently good 3 decades ago.

@J.PrudentVigor82,2024-01-31T21:29:07Z,2024-01-31T21:30:31Z,0,"I think 🤔 it&#39;s kind of insulting to the memory of Patrick Swayze to create another Road House movie. The original was good 1980s fun I feel should&#39;ve been left alone. This new movie looks like Stupid fun But Jake Gyllenhaal can definitely not fill the The shoes of the one great  Patrick Swayze&#39;s. He doesn&#39;t have the swagger Patrick Swayze had. Hopefully the story is different enough for Jake Gyllenhaal to make his own kind of &quot;Dalton&quot; Character, and hopefully it&#39;s a fun watch."

However he is a great fighter and athlete with a lot of heart and attitude and that’s what he brings to the screen, you got a great actor, Jake Gyllenhal in this , that’s enough to make for an entertaining film, the two of these guys can learn a lot from each other. If they directed and produced this right it should be pretty entertaining. We will see."

Perfect example is when Dalton goes to grab tires out of the junkyard because he knows they&#39;ll most likely get slashed later. In film today they would have some garbage dialogue or quip to &quot;explain&quot; to the audience why he&#39;s doing this.

YET......once again......all the Chipotle Generation of film makers can do is copy an old idea.   Double up on the Xanax.  Get another tattoo. Wag your finger and sway your head when you talk. But seriously, be ashamed. No creativity. No imagination. No history and heritage. This is example number 1,201,040.  LOL.   &quot;Peace out!&quot;.   PS: Why not make another movie that has the words Fast or Furious in the title? Install some whazzup dawg humor into it and call it a day.     Bonus: Most of the remakes made by the Extra Guac people -- - will be seen once.   While the real versions continue to be more iconic and popular.

It is a shame they are trying to ride on the coat tails of the original Road House to get attention. It is nothing like the original Road House. There are a few similarities but they could have easily named it something else and been good on their own. But I guess they don&#39;t have enough faith in their movie for that.

I dont want a single ounce of cgi in any imagining of Roadhouse.  Camp made the original great.   Seeing the monster truck drive through the dealership -that was real and hilariously great.   Swayze cannot be replaced.

The actors and the director certainly appear to have put in the work here, but it would have been nice for the studio to invest in writing something new and interesting. Maybe the film itself reveals that this is not &quot;Road House,&quot; but maybe &quot;Another Road House.&quot; That would be better."

@Alexanderthegreat159,2024-01-28T11:04:32Z,2024-01-28T11:08:03Z,1,Why did they make Dalton so much less put together than the original version? Like they make the man sleep in his car and s*** when the other guy you don&#39;t had a place and everything even gave away his car to a homeless man cuz he already had another car ready. 🤔 Definitely a weird change. I mean I guess they&#39;re going for a light reboot by changing the story up enough and stuff so maybe it won&#39;t be so bad.

Despite all this, it&#39;s been more than 8 years since I was properly with someone and that only lasted a few months. Time before that I was the victim of gaslighting and quite an abusive relationship going back 12 years now.<br><br>For several years now I&#39;ve gone on dates and it goes nowhere because I&#39;m generally not meeting women I find physically attractive because the ones I see on these apps aren&#39;t into me. I sometimes match with them but then no response. I guess as an attractive woman, they will always have so much more choice and get snapped up quick. <br><br>What&#39;s more, I am still a virgin technically speaking, despite having had multiple opportunities over the years with the few relationships I&#39;ve had and then one off flings and &quot;one night stands&quot; which I really regret even going that far because it was wrong. But never had full intercourse. I wanted to save myself for marriage and do what&#39;s right before God but I guess the wife and the marriage never happened. I hope it&#39;s not too late but it&#39;s certainly getting to a point where I&#39;m worried whether anything will change. <br><br>I understand that confidence and being content on your own is key, however I can&#39;t seem to shake off the feeling of failure and being unable to find and attract a woman that I want. Being on my own for so long, I can&#39;t see how it can be beneficial for anyone to be this way for this long and not have companionship. I don&#39;t mind being on my own, as I said I&#39;ve travelled a ton, I&#39;ve been to almost 70 countries now and the vast majority of that on my own."

Looks like a fun movie, the stunts look especially well done(thank you again John Wick for raising the standard for action in America)."

I’m not really <b>enjoying</b> seeing the two rivals go at it beyond the surface level. Nothing on screen isn’t something that I’ve already seen a dozen times before. <br><br>I understand that this may be because I have a certain bias (I’m more of a tokusatsu/superhero kinda guy; both Blue Beetle and Black Panther are some of my favorite films, and I’m a big fan of Ultraman), but I’m kinda expecting a little more out of a film about an MMA-experienced bouncer.

@1genxgamer10,2024-01-27T20:30:04Z,2024-01-27T20:30:04Z,0,FAIL remake.  They cannot create new things so they just destroy what already has been created which means to me that none of those actors who participate in a remake are worth watching.  Neither is the story.

@RandomAxeOfKindness,2024-01-27T16:59:26Z,2024-01-27T16:59:26Z,0,"It looks like it could be good.  The editing doesn&#39;t floyd the action too much, the curse of modern Hollywood action scenes.  But it&#39;s more of an original film with little nods to the original, as the premise and plot really aren&#39;t the same.  The original Road House was a sort of resurrection of The Sheep Man (with Glenn Ford, Leslie Nielsen, et al), where the point is that the main character has done this a hundred times and generally knows exactly what the bad guys are going to do before they do it.  In this one, Gyllenhaal&#39;s a tough smart guy but a novice in the situation they drop him in.  Different kind of protagonist.  Should be fine."

Change the name of the central character as it&#39;s nothing like the original. As for the original, one of the best movies ever made... That belongs to Patrick Swayze. Everyone knows that.

Very different vibe from the Swayze classic.<br>James Dalton was someone whose past was a mystery.<br>Elwood Dalton starts out with everybody knowing who he is.<br>The original movie has towns folks rise up in the end with help of Dalton.<br>The new movie... I don&#39;t know. We&#39;ll see.

I understand that him being in the UFC makes sense to fill in on knowing how to fight and all just like Jimmy and Dalton in the first one are a match but i liked how the first one is a mysterious guy became a legend on his own nevertheless i will be see this movie for just the mindless violence lol

He is a mysterious stranger, known only by reputation, like Chang, or Clint Eastwood&#39;s the man with no name. Maybe he is just a force of nature, come to life as an agent of justice. Or maybe he is a disgraced something or other... who knows! Other than that, all you gotta know is that somewhere along the line his badassery led him to being a roadhouse regulator, and all that matters is right effing now. There is no future, there is no past, just a tough guy in the present who promised to do some good in the world--and makes good on his promise violently. <br><br>That&#39;s why the original rocked. It borrowed from a rich history--the lone samurai. Plus the 80s stuff... totally hot chicks and over the top fights, obviously."

I guess it&#39;s the injection of the UFC that rubs me the wrong way, I totally get it as a marketing thing, but the original was so over the top but on such a small local scale that it made all the action and shlock hilarious and fun. This looks almost over-produced. But am I going to watch it? Of course! RIP Swayze, a real one."

@theangrycarrot1363,2024-01-26T18:59:12Z,2024-01-26T18:59:12Z,1,I&#39;m sorry but this movie should not be called Road House. For some of us who grew up in the 80s Road House is a timeless classic with the legend Patrick Swayze. The movie was more than just fighting for us. It was about friendship and love and the loyalties that come with that. Jake G is old enough to know better.

Sounds fun and not preachy at all. FFS Hollywood diversity does not just mean black female.

In this, he is overly-confident and almost relishes in fights, as if they are so easy they are fun for him. In the original, he was confident and knew his power but did not flaunt it. He was wise but acted only when he felt necessary. He was humble. This new version is not so humble. And this is why movies are lackluster now.

At least let the movies have a solid two or three months run before putting it on streaming.<br><br>Conor may have found a valid reason not to be involved with UFC. Depending on how greatly his acting skills are in this film and if he constantly trains at acting and take the right roles he could easily transition into full tike acting

@patrykdomanski9409,2024-01-26T11:20:55Z,2024-01-26T11:20:55Z,0,"Directors words: My plan had been to silently protest Amazon’s decision to stream a movie so clearly made for the big screen. But Amazon is hurting way more than just me and my film. If I don’t speak up about Amazon, who will? So here we go.<br><br>When Amazon bought MGM, one of the few remaining studios making big commercial films for theatrical release (movies like Bond, Creed) they announced that they would put a billion dollars into theatrical motion pictures, releasing at least 12 a year. They touted it as “the largest commitment to cinemas by an internet company.” I can tell you what they then did to me and my film Road House, which is the opposite of what they promised when they took over MGM.<br><br>The facts: I signed up to make a theatrical motion picture for MGM. Amazon bought MGM. Amazon said make a great film and we will see what happens. I made a great film. <br><br>We made Road House a “smash hit” – Amazon’s words not mine, btw. Road House tested higher than my biggest box office hit, Mr. and Mrs Smith. It tested higher than Bourne Identity, which spawned four sequels. I’m told the press response has been Amazon’s best since they bought MGM. Road House has a strong tie-in to the UFC, which has a rabid and loyal fan base that has spawned over 1.5 billion social media impressions for the film, and marketing hasn’t even started yet. The action is ground-breaking. And Jake Gyllenhaal gives a career-defining performance in a role he was born to play. Audiences will want to see UFC mega-star Conor McGregor take his debut swing at Jake on the big screen. The reality is there’s nothing quite so fun as a good bar fight. <br><br>What else could I have delivered to the studio? Nothing, it turns out. Because contrary to their public statements, Amazon has no interest in supporting cinemas. Amazon will exclusively stream Road House on Amazon’s Prime. Amazon asked me and the film community to trust them and their public statements about supporting cinemas, and then they turned around and are using Road House to sell plumbing fixtures.<br><br>That hurts the filmmakers and stars of Road House who don’t share in the upside of a hit movie on a streaming platform. And they deprive Jake Gyllenhaal — who gives a career-best performance — the opportunity to be recognized come award season. But the impact goes far beyond this one movie. This could be industry shaping for decades to come. <br><br><br>/Deadline ©️"

And BTW those guys all look the same to me that way, not having there own style. <br>Van Damme had his style. Seagal had his style. Snipes did too... And also late Patrick Swayze. Adkins while also kinda MMA related in some of his movies, has at the very least his own thing with the flying kicks and that kind of stuff... But here, I just can see any MMA fighter in place of them and it would be the same as far as fighting scenes goes. Sh*t. Maybe too old for this..."

This should never have been titled Road House, but something stand alone in order to give it its own credibility. This is why Hollywood is going down the pan - no originality. They try to get around this glaring issue by stating it&#39;s a &#39;remake/reimagining/reworking&#39; - it&#39;s just arrogance and laziness."

Not a super fan of connor but his personality i thino makes good villain for the hero. Ok had to edit to say im seeing way to much comedy its the problem some movies suffer from they just adding comedy like every scene had it from looks of it original didnt have little to none here is lol every moment.

@capsjukebox,2024-01-26T03:49:06Z,2024-01-26T03:49:06Z,0,Ok McGregor might actually come close to the insane villain energy of Ben Gazarra in the original
@harshgarrett,2024-01-26T03:49:02Z,2024-01-26T03:49:02Z,0,"Looks completely unnecessary and a disservice to the original. Usually I love gyllenhall but he’s been doing miss after miss after miss lately. Ambulance, the covenant were terrible and this looks like another throwaway movie with bad writing and acting filling the streaming void."

@Farwalker2u,2024-01-26T03:48:03Z,2024-01-26T03:48:03Z,0,In the original the line Swayze delivered to the Doctor was &quot;Pain don&#39;t hurt.&quot;  Revealing his philosophy and reality.<br>Gyllenhaal&#39;s character says a line which is an apologetic line of: &quot;No one ever wins a fight.&quot;  Just wrong.  Actually often some one wins a fight.

The only thing that makes me kinda hesitant is the fight scenes look like they may of gone way over the top. Some of it looks almost cartoonish and not even remotely realistic.. even for Hollywood standards. But that may just be the trailers and them trying to create a wow factor. I’m absolutely watching it regardless

I just don&#39;t get this modern need to cling on to old names which just creates baggage. This movie could have the exact same story while having a different title and become its own thing.

The original was outrageous but had enough decent actors to where it was fun to watch. <br><br>Besides the whole point of Dalton was his degree from NYU in philosophy. He wasn’t an MMA fighter or a boxer. It’s like the awful remake of Point Break where they took the surfing out of the movie and made the new Keanu some extreme sports enthusiast. Part of the character in the originals was their disconnect from their surroundings."

It&#39;s sad that we continue to get the same stuff. Having said that I still wanna see this as Jake&#39;s a great actor but you never know what you are gonna get but this looks like a action movie that seems trashy but in the best way!! We don&#39;t get these action movies and what we get today isn&#39;t what we once truly called action movies!! Sadly I don&#39;t have prime but this might get me to. Sucks we won&#39;t see a physical release outside of Bootleg.

@Drew791,2024-01-26T01:35:29Z,2024-01-26T01:35:29Z,0,Since Conor is playing the villain (essentially himself at all times) you know he’s going to get destroyed in spectacular fashion by the hero; which should be quite satisfying!

However he s so bad for this role, playing the nice guy killer. The fact that Patrick had a dark side in the original was pretty good for his character development. They should have made Conor the main character and keep his instability.<br>I really would not watch this if McGreggor wasnt in it. This is pretty much selling Conor videos."

@redman112010,2024-01-26T00:57:24Z,2024-01-26T00:57:24Z,0,So glad it wasn&#39;t wokified and made into a woman cat fight film. So far it seems like it was appropriately updated for today&#39;s time and holds true to what Roadhouse was about.
@r4y1996,2024-01-26T00:57:14Z,2024-01-26T00:57:14Z,0,"My only complaint about this so far is it doesn’t look like they’re using Daltons rules. I know it’s a modernized remake, but it’s a remake nonetheless. Needs to have some OG callbacks. Daltons rules would be the number 1 thing I think. It does show him saying “no one ever wins a fight” however, so that’s a plus<br><br>But in reading the cast, I had a feeling they were gonna make the idiotic guy from Game Night the bad guy. But I was in the air with Conor McGregor. I figured he’d either be the main bad bodyguard or a modernized Wade Garrett.<br><br>Overall though, it looks surprisingly entertaining"

@daytonsimpson9963,2024-01-25T22:46:26Z,2024-01-25T22:46:26Z,0,I get the feeling that this movie will be a bit similar to how I felt about the recent Point Break remake. I&#39;ll like the the new modern version but it still won&#39;t hit the same spot that the orignal did. Really excited to see Conor in this film though
@anibalcolon46,2024-01-25T22:45:59Z,2024-01-25T22:45:59Z,0,Roadhouse will always be the original with Patrick Swayze and Sam Elliot. Check that one out first👍

For some reason when I saw the teasers or stuff building up for this movie I thought Conor was a friend of Jake Gyllenhaals Dalton. But I guess he&#39;s just a generic hired goon for the movies main boss. Kind of lame.

@frankburton670,2024-01-25T21:28:07Z,2024-01-25T21:28:07Z,0,"Not sure I am going to like this version as much. After all, you&#39;re calling this Road House and the original Road House was in Kansas and called the Double Deuce. If you are going to take a classic movie such as Road House and remake it, it needs to be at least close to the original and not changed so much. Otherwise why call it Road House. I will most likely see it at some point. But to me as in this preview, it&#39;s changed way too much,"

Was one of my moms favorites, seen it hundreds of times as a kid. So it holds a special place for me, but i will not judge as looking from the trailer it&#39;s not a remake, its a reinterpretation, so doesn&#39;t need to stick to the original. Looks like a fun movie...but for sure does not need a theater release lol"

Prime Video should feel humiliated and fire the person who even wants to do a remakes, me personally i don&#39;t think Prime Video has it in them to come up with something original and make use of their writers talents. keep playing the safe card and you will also fail like some other apps have been."

@SchulzEricT,2024-01-25T20:04:00Z,2024-02-12T23:03:05Z,1,"Well.... probably not a movie that should be re-made. Like &quot;Red Dawn&quot;, like &quot;Point Break&quot;, it&#39;s not like it&#39;s a great idea, it&#39;s a classic movie because something during it&#39;s execution worked, almost in spite of the dumb idea, that made it really fun. Re-makes should be about finding great ideas that weren&#39;t executed well; those movies are the opposite, it was all (or at least, mostly) about how the execution worked to elevate ideas that were, if not bad, still not very good, so that they were very good, fun, watchable movies. So... the &quot;Road House&quot; re-make is fighting an uphill battle to start.<br>THEN we have the classic &quot;we need to show his backstory, how did he become a bouncer in the first place&quot; trap that new movies love to fall into. No more starting in media res, we ALWAYS have to deal with the origin story these days. The 1st movie (in a planned franchise, rarely executed when the 1st movie fails to perform well enough to warrant a sequel... I wonder why) typically <b>ends</b> with the setup to the <b>actual</b> movie so that the 2nd movie is the actual movie (Mortal Kombat!). This trailer, as fun as it looks, seems like it&#39;s kinda setting that up, outlining that exact scenario.<br>SO... it looks fun, Gyllenhaal seems to hit the right note as Dalton, but man... I&#39;m skeptical."

@NecroxProduction,2024-01-25T18:27:28Z,2024-01-25T18:27:28Z,0,"The fighting looks as choreographed as ever. It&#39;s time to upgrade the fighting in movies. There&#39;s plenty of material to learn from. Remember how in 80s-90s movies everybody was shooting from the hip, fingers on the trigger at all times. Then they started hiring gun experts and now actors hold guns like real soldiers. The same needs to happen to fighting. These super precise hits and blocks look goofy nowadays after watching MMA and seeing how a real fight really looks like."

You probably wont have that awesome final scene of the bad guys death, there would be a lot more John wick style action, etc etc. i am interested to see how a modern version stacks up, especially because they aren&#39;t doing some “copy-paste” movie where they just make the same movie with different actors. Swayze made the og what it was and still remains to this day one of the best actors to ever grace us with his performance."

They didn&#39;t venture off the path of the original much though huh, almost scene for scene, the knife guy, the brawl outside setting the stage, its lick for lick almost identical, probably why it didn&#39;t get theatrical."

Road House will remain unique and visually, this has nothing to do with it.  The title is misleading.  McGregor&#39;s presence is as insufferable as always.  It&#39;s OK.

With all the resources Amazon has why can’t you you create original content instead of just remaking existing movies? It’s not that difficult to hire quality writers to write quality content and scripts. There’s a lot of talent out there.

Road House was a cheesy movie that had no business being as good as it was, it was rough and gritty, the is too shiny. Not saying it looks horrible, just that it&#39;s gonna hard to capture the magic of the original. Swayze made that movie. It would have been better if they just paid homage to the original in the film, maybe a have a shout-out to the swayze&#39;s character and called it something else. Just my opinion of a girl the watched the original when it came out back in 89 and it&#39;s favorite in my family."

Looks like takes a few losses(looks like Connor is going to get the better of him in their first clash). I love that. The only other actor I can think of that played badass(but not completely perfect) characters that failed and or took losses was Jean Claude Van Damme. He would trail through henchmen and meet a stronger opponent, lose(badly) and then run it back later on and win."

A fight is about to start and he walks up to both combatants towering over both.  They look down sheepishly, apologize to each other and walk out of the bar.  End credits while Dalton drinks his black coffee and reads the apartment&#39;s for rent in the want ads section of the newspaper. Total screen time?  10 minutes with beginning and ending credits."

This will not be anywhere close to being as good as the original film. Even the director to video sequel in road house 2 is better than this movie. And at least in the sequel they made the main character a relative of Daltons and not some corny attempt at a remake. <br><br>Road House 1-2 are just overall better than what we see here at a rebooted attempt that shouldn’t have happened to begin with.

Jake G is always good but this is a major misstep. Definitely see why Amazon didn&#39;t want to put this in theaters.
@jonathanamid2759,2024-01-25T16:38:32Z,2024-01-25T16:38:32Z,0,Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah exhale!!!! This actually doesn&#39;t look like hot garbage at all and Conor looks like he&#39;s legit killing it! Deadpan Jake G is really fun and they clearly have a good script that doesn&#39;t take itself too seriously. This could be the sleeper hit of the year - really should&#39;ve had a theatrical release. We NEED these straightforward crowdpleasers now more than ever.

Seriously they do appear to have missed the genuinely important bits like him being basically a philosopher warrior in the original and a professional cooler as opposed to a bouncer. That&#39;s the entire point of the film. I do not expect the bad guy to end up having breathing difficulties in quite the same way and that&#39;ll be the nail in the coffin."

U can tell its borrowing some elements of the original film to keep the feel of Road House in the film, but it&#39;s combined with it&#39;s own original ideas that gives it its own identity instead of just being a copy and paste of the original film. I actually appreciate what they did here and looking forward to it."

SOOOOOOO refreshing to see some manly men in a film instead of some forced girl boss barking instruction at a bunch of cucked beta male feminists. I wish we could reboot these movies so that this weak generation of men can taste some testosterone lol. Connor could help bring Jason Statham type movies back again.

@Winchester-7,2024-01-25T15:10:46Z,2024-01-25T15:10:46Z,0,Looks terrible.  Even more with that junkie playing a bad guy.
