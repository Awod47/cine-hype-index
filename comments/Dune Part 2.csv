This unnecessary waste of CGI insults its audience on every level, attaching painful hubris and cloying gravitas to the most cliched and well trodden statements. And, tepid acting and by the numbers Other World story arcs aside......please, for the love of chemical chance, can this sludh be the final appearance, pretty please, of invented languages which are blatant Jabba the Hut ripoffs. Zendaya gets points for frckability, but if youre over 14, or female, this movie will take a few hours from your life, and give you brain ulcers, at best."

@VoldoronGaming,2024-06-11T03:06:13Z,2024-06-11T03:08:32Z,0,I must say muad’dib riding the worm was my favorite scene and how it affected Chani and Stilgar fit their characters. For chani is was pride relief and excitement all rolled into one. For stilgar he is literally watching prophecy come true before his very eyes and looks overwhelmed. Not confirmation of decades of belief but stunned and overwhelmed at the same time. Just spectacular. You can almost feel this is what riding the controlling a giant worm would feel like and look like and it just so happens to be the biggest one anyone has ever seen.

@paulnantulya,2024-05-28T01:11:19Z,2024-05-28T01:11:19Z,0,"As someone who worked in Sudan for many years, this series and the books that it is rooted in, is unashamedly about Arabs, their culture, heroes, and their experiences of colonialism, great power tussles, and the struggle for their resources (oil is pithily presented as &quot;spice&quot; for example). I only wish that peoples from the lands that inspired Dune were included as actors, script writers, and consultants. Many of the names and concepts that are descriptive of awe inspiring elements like the &quot;eyes of Ibad&quot; and &quot;shai hulud&quot; and the &quot;mahdi&quot; are mispronounced, even if they are placed in a historical context that is basically correct. I hope they draw more on the indegenous cultures and peoples in the next series. But a must watch nonetheless."

Islam promise of eternal paradise &quot;وجنات تجري من تحتها الانهار” which literally translates to “Paradise forests where rivers flow under it” here where there are no rivers in the Arabian peninsula and very scarce water sources. I think this movie captures a bit of the essence of the spiritual longing of the Arabs and their cry for life and what gave them the strength to conquer the world during the Islamic conquest."

@JamesPaterson-j1s,2024-04-19T18:03:28Z,2024-04-19T18:03:28Z,2,They are starting to ruin one of my favorite stories of all times. They did not stick to the original story line at all. Focused more on his girl then on the main character. And they neglected to show the original fight seen. He destroyed the harconen not the other way around as was shown in the final fight seen. Great graphics is pretty much all I can say. If the 3rd part does not get back to its original story line I doubt many true fans of the book will call it a good movie. The first one was great. I can not say the same for the second part. They will destroy this movie just like they did to the Dark Tower movie. because of the graphics I give it a 9. but because they did not stay true to the story including the fact that his lets call her wife received more attention and they changed her character completely from agreeing with him all the way and giving her a role that was never mentioned in the books it drops down to a. I am so dissapointed. The best on screen version of this series was the sci fi channel series.

It&#39;s one of the best movies I&#39;ve seen in a while and I was impressed for once. Being a Dune fan, I had high expectations for the first movie which (probably mostly because I wasn&#39;t paying enough attention) felt really slow and boring.<br><br>But this gem stood out and was completely different from the first movie. I loved everything from the beautiful story to the acting to the action scenes. Everything flowed perfectly together from beginning to end. <br><br>If I were to nitpick on something, it would be more variation, as most of the movie focuses on Paul and the Fremen in the desert. It got tedious at times and I felt that the movie lacked story in-depth. Nonetheless, I still felt the movie did a good job focusing on the Harkonnens and their situation as well. Feyd was especially a pleasant surprise, as he was very badass, to say the least. His ruthlessness and coldbloodedness can&#39;t be denied to the point even I was surprised by his zero tolerance.<br> <br>All in all, this movie is a masterpiece. A 10 out of 10. I actually played Dune II, my favorite RTS game of all time right before watching Dune Part II so that should tell you how much I love this series, whether it&#39;s the games or the movies.<br><br>So yeah, if you haven&#39;t seen this movie yet, watch it because you won&#39;t be disappointed!"

The setting, the garb, the use of Arabic and Muslim religious constructs throughout the film are groundbreaking. The resemblance of the Fremen people to the Bedouins is uncanny. The allusions to the Middle East are unmistakable, especially as the novel came on the heels of the oil boom in the Gulf states. Frank Herbert’s editors initially asked him to tone down the “Muslim flavor” of his book. Trying to avoid Herbert’s apparent insensitivity, the filmmakers actively subdued most elements of Islam, the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). The new movie treats religion, ecology, capitalism and colonialism as broad abstractions, stripped of particularity."

The scene shot from above as Paul moves through the huge crowd of Freman is a visual reference to him being the Kwisatz Haderach. In Dune part 1 Mohiam says &quot;Like sifting sand through a screen we sift people&quot;. The scene from above resembles grains of sand with Paul sifting through them and being separate because he is the Kwisatz Haderach that the Bene Gesserit have been working towards all those years.

There is nothing remotely recognizable in most of these characters (not even the way their names are pronounced) or the the plot points when compared to the source material. Some of the changes are so far fetched they are anger inducing. No spoilers here, suffice it to say this is NOT Frank Herbert&#39;s Dune. Aside from the visuals of the worlds and the soundtrack I didn&#39;t like much of anything about this film. This train has gone so far off the rails it can&#39;t come back. I wish I were capable of ignoring the source material as a viewer the way the writers and director have done. Then I might&#39;ve enjoyed it.<br>I have read most of the Dune series three times. A few of them more, so it it difficult to unlearn or to unknow and to just go with the flow of these films.<br>As is the case for many Books and Novels adapted for TV and film... ignorance is bliss."

Where were the pulse weapons and the weirding way found in the book and where was his sister Aliyah? I know the books are usually better than the movies but this just seemed to be lacking something. I still think the 2000 TV inseries overall was and is the best. The story sticks close to the books; the cinemetography is immaculate and it is well acted.

@michaelcromwell8314,2024-03-08T20:46:23Z,2024-03-08T20:46:23Z,1,"I did not like this movie after liking the 80s version somewhat. But this version is boring, slow, with poor acting, simplistic dialogue, slow and uneven pacing and scene arrangements, weirdness for the sake of being weird, unnecessary closeups of actors, and the wrong choices for actors in the first place. I like my lead heroes to be big and strong and not small, meek-looking, and barely 100 pounds like Timothee Chalamet. This director should not be asked to do epic films anymore. They are too big for him, in my opinion. Zach Snyder (DC Comics) or the Russo Brothers (Marvel) might have had more exciting takes on the Dune saga. Denis Villeneuve&#39;s version was a waste of time and money, in my opinion -- the movie studio&#39;s money, and the money I spent at the box office and concession stand. I nearly fell asleep in the theater. Overall, this was a wasted opportunity! Finally, I am sick of people who say they love something when they know deep down it was really bad. That make us all liars and that goes for professional critics and ordinary people!"

The best parts of Dune 2 you can see in this trailer...many of the scenes are self indulging on good sound and screen effects - but each of the more passive scenes are just elongated unnecessarily (not that someboy would miss them in the storyline), as if Vilneuve had to fill 3 hours and his buget of 190Mio. wasnt enough.<br>The &quot;action&quot; you might expect after Dune1 and all the looong preparation in Dune 2 is more than sparse  and would have made this film to be watched a 2nd time... but yeahh &quot;professional&quot; critiques seem to love the great pictures but forget the pace, plot and action (even the books are offering more action!).<br>Pitty for the guranteed hype this film got, they could have done it so much better"

This is literally one of the best movies I’ve ever seen and probably one of the best I’ve ever seen in a cinema.

The visuals, audio and story are on point no question but it doesnt help me when the movie bores me at all. From visual its an artpiece like a art painting but it feels like u almost just stare 3h at the same painting. No way for me this come any close to the first star wars movies or something. For me it feels extremly overrated. Its just my opinion."
